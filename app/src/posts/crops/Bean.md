## Overview

- Soybeans play a role in purifying the atmosphere by absorbing carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) through photosynthesis and releasing oxygen. On average, soybeans fix 3.01 tons of CO₂ and release 2.18 tons of oxygen per hectare annually.

- Soybeans are an environmentally friendly crop that requires less fertilizer compared to other crops. They help reduce the use of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers, which are major causes of water pollution. Through nitrogen fixation by root nodule bacteria, soybeans can fix up to 100 kg of nitrogen per hectare per year. The residue of soybean plants can also be used as animal feed or organic material.

- Despite their ability to absorb heavy metals from the soil, soybeans have low levels of heavy metals in the seeds, making them safe for consumption.

- Soybeans contain about 40% protein, 30% carbohydrates, and 20% fat. While they contain almost no starch, their high protein content makes them one of the most nutritionally rich crops found on Earth. They are also a good source of dietary fiber, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, folic acid, vitamin K, iron, zinc, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium.

## Cultivation Environment

- Healthy soybean seeds will germinate when they are provided with sufficient water, appropriate temperature, and air (oxygen) after planting. When the soil temperature is between 15–30°C and moisture is adequate, germination usually begins within 3 to 5 days. Since soybean seeds absorb water before germinating, maintaining adequate moisture during the germination period is especially important.

- Soybean seeds can absorb moisture up to 130–150% of their dry weight, though only about 100% absorption is necessary for germination. While soybeans can germinate at temperatures ranging from 4°C to 42°C, both the time required for germination and germination rate vary significantly depending on the temperature. Optimal emergence generally occurs at 25–35°C.

- Each stage of growth—sowing, germination, vegetative growth, nitrogen fixation, flowering, and maturity—has its own optimal temperature. Moderate daily temperature fluctuations are beneficial for fruiting and seed quality, whereas abnormal temperature extremes during the growing season can hinder these processes.

- The degree of damage from temperature changes depends on the crop’s growth stage at the time of the stress. Soybeans can germinate between 5–40°C, and the optimal temperature for hypocotyl (embryonic stem) elongation is around 30°C. If temperatures fall below 18°C, pods may not form. The maximum seed weight and number of pods per plant occur at 30°C. During the fruiting stage, the optimal nighttime temperature is 20–25°C, and a large difference between day and night temperatures improves seed quality.

- Compared to crops like corn, sorghum, and alfalfa, soybeans have much lower ability to absorb water from the soil and mainly use moisture from within 50 cm of the topsoil. When soil moisture is insufficient, above-ground growth and nitrogen assimilation are negatively affected. It also reduces the uptake of nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and potassium, leading to even more severe deficiencies in low-fertility soils.

- Problems caused by excess moisture occur when there is more water than the soil can retain, leading to not only direct root damage but also secondary issues due to changes in soil air composition and nutrient availability.

- The ideal soil for soybean cultivation has deep topsoil, high water-holding capacity, good drainage, neutral pH, and is rich in organic matter, lime, and potassium. The most suitable soil textures are sandy loam and silty loam, but soybeans can adapt to sandy soil, clay, or newly reclaimed land to some extent. The ideal soil moisture is 70–90% of field capacity, while moisture levels above 100% can cause damage due to excessive wetness.

_When growing soybeans on newly cultivated land._

- Fertilizer placement during sowing involves applying fertilizer in the furrow or next to it, then covering it with soil before sowing the seeds. This method allows for the most efficient use of fertilizer. However, care must be taken to prevent direct contact between the fertilizer and the seeds.

- Among soybean cultivation practices, inter-row cultivation (weeding between rows) and hilling (covering the base of the plants with soil) are important tasks.

    - Inter-row cultivation refers to scratching or loosening the soil between the rows during the early growth stages of soybeans.

    - Hilling means pulling soil from between rows to cover the base of the young plants. Generally, inter-row cultivation is performed once, about 30 days after sowing, when the effect of herbicides begins to fade. If no herbicide was applied after sowing, it is necessary to perform 1–2 rounds of inter-row cultivation slightly earlier.

- Hilling is usually done together with inter-row cultivation. Using multi-purpose cultivators or tractor-mounted cultivator-hillers can reduce both labor and cost. It is recommended to perform hilling 2–3 times, as it also helps control weeds. When herbicides are used, one round of hilling around 30–40 days after sowing is ideal, raising the soil to cover up to the first true leaf node of the soybean plant. However, hilling must be completed at least 10 days before flowering. If done too late, the stem becomes woody, making it difficult for new adventitious roots to emerge, and existing roots may be damaged during the process.

- When soybeans are planted early or in fertile soil at high planting density, they may grow too tall and become prone to lodging (falling over). In such cases, it is recommended to pinch the top of the main stem (removing the growing point) in advance. This practice, called topping or pinching, helps promote side branching, leading to more pods and improved yield, while also reducing lodging.

- A recent issue in soybean cultivation is the increased damage from pests and diseases due to climate change.
Soybean diseases are caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses. Disease control methods vary depending on the type of pathogen:

    - Fungal diseases are relatively easier to manage,

    - Bacterial diseases are more difficult, and

    - Viral diseases require the use of registered antiviral treatments.
