## Overview
- In general, to cultivate crops, you need to be well-prepared with compost, fertilizer, herbicides, and insecticides. You also need to till the land and create ridges (raised beds).

- First, human or animal manure must be well mixed with straw or sawdust and fully composted. Then, after visiting the local market to check fertilizer prices, the necessary amount should be purchased and mixed with the compost to create compound fertilizer.

- Compound fertilizer combines the advantages of compost and chemical fertilizer while offsetting their weaknesses. This is becoming a global trend in agriculture.

- Compost is made by stacking straw, weeds, fallen leaves, etc., for a period of time and letting microorganisms decompose and ferment the organic matter. High-quality compost often includes animal manure (cow, pig, or chicken) and is rich in nitrogen.

- Compost is gentle on plant roots, even if it comes into direct contact.

- It contains small but balanced amounts of 20‚Äì30 different nutrients, promotes healthy plant growth, has slow but reliable effects, and retains moisture well, making it effective in drought resistance.

- Chemical fertilizers, on the other hand, are harsh on plant roots if applied directly, as they contain high concentrations of one or two nutrients.

- They are used primarily to boost yields, work quickly, but also dissipate quickly and retain little moisture, offering limited benefit during dry conditions.

- Compound fertilizers allow beneficial microbes in compost to break down soil pollutants and toxins. They also help reduce wastewater runoff by decreasing chemical fertilizer use, prevent soil erosion during heavy rains, and provide habitats for beneficial microorganisms in the soil.


# Making Compound Fertilizer

## Overview

- A good **compound fertilizer** should:
  - Have **no strong odor** (only a mild yeast-like smell at most).
  - Contain **moderate moisture**.
  - Be **completely decomposed** and unrecognizable about **6 months after application**.

- **Too much sawdust or wood chips**:
  - Slows down fermentation.
  - Reduces moisture retention.
  - Can lead to **dry soil**, so **moisture must be supplemented**.

- **Compost made from food waste** often contains **high salt** ‚Üí reduce salt content before use.

- Ideal **Carbon:Nitrogen (C:N)** ratio is **30:1**.
  - A practical way to achieve this:  
    **Brown materials : Green materials = 1 : 3**

- Compost should maintain **~50% moisture**.
  - Fill container with a mix of:
    - Hay
    - Sawdust
    - Lime nitrogen
    - Oil cake
    - Rice husks
    - Rice straw
    - Chicken manure
    - Farmyard manure

- **Outdoor composting**: Prevent **external water infiltration**.

- **Compost bin** must have a **drainage outlet**.
- Regularly collect **garden/kitchen waste** and **cut it into small pieces** to speed up fermentation.

- The **main reason crops don‚Äôt grow well** is due to **nutrient deficiency**.

- In situations where **chemical fertilizers are unavailable**, homemade **compound fertilizer** is ideal for home gardens.

## ‚ñ° How to Make Nutrient-Rich Compound Fertilizer Without Chemicals

### üü© Nitrogen (N)

- Use **pig or chicken manure**.
- Supplement with **soaked ash water** (from sesame or rice straw).
- **Human urine** is also a great nitrogen source. Collect and **ferment before use**.

### üü™ Phosphorus (P)

- Important for:
  - **Carbohydrate and energy metabolism**
  - **Root and branch development**
  - **Respiration**
  - **Flower and fruit growth**

- **Deficiency symptoms**:
  - Leaves turn **yellow** and **narrow**.
  - Poor fruit set.
  - Less sweetness in fruits/grains.

- **Overuse** may cause:
  - Zinc and iron deficiency
  - Excessive vegetative growth ‚Üí **low yield**

- **Sources**:
  - Human waste (especially feces)
  - Chicken manure
  - Ferment with:
    - **Rice bran**  
    - **Bone meal** (10%)

> **Rice bran composition**:  
> Protein 13%, Fat 16%, Nitrogen 3%, Phosphorus 6%, Potassium 3%

- Ensure **complete fermentation** to remove harmful gases.  
- Feeding rice bran to livestock and using the **manure** is also effective.

### üü® Potassium (K)

- Promotes **root and stem development**.
- **Deficiency** causes:
  - Leaf degradation
  - Impaired photosynthesis
  - Stunted stem growth

- Use **ash water**:
  - Burned sesame stalks or rice straw
  - Steep ash in **water at a 1:100 ratio** for **2 weeks**
  - Use liquid form only

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do **not** mix raw ash directly with feces and apply to fields.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Cautions

- Overuse of organic fertilizers can lead to:
  - **Nutrient accumulation**
  - **Salt buildup (salinity stress)**

- Using **unfermented organic material** may cause:
  - **Toxic gases** during decomposition
  - **Root damage and growth inhibition**
