        <h1>Feed</h1>
<h2>▣ Feeding Principles</h2>
<p>The key point in raising replacement heifers is to <strong>provide high-quality roughage ad libitum</strong> (free-choice feeding). Additionally, it is important to maintain a <strong>daily weight gain of 500–600g before the onset of puberty</strong>, enabling heifers to reach sexual maturity around 12–15 months of age.</p>
<p>When purchasing replacement heifers externally, it is advisable to prioritize <strong>healthy and well-conditioned animals</strong> with smooth body outlines over low prices.</p>
<p>The feeding standard for heifers should be:
- <strong>Provide as much high-quality roughage as possible.</strong>
- Use <strong>concentrates only to supplement nutrient deficiencies.</strong></p>
<p>Providing sufficient quality roughage is a critical focus not only for breeding heifers but also for those raised for fattening. High-quality roughage:
- <strong>Maximizes the development of the rumen</strong>, especially the <strong>first (rumen)</strong> and <strong>second stomach (reticulum)</strong>.
- Promotes healthy development of the <strong>post-ruminal digestive tract</strong>.</p>
<h3>Risks of Inadequate Roughage:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can lead to digestive issues or liver disorders.</li>
<li>May shorten the animal's productive reproductive lifespan.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also important to ensure that the animal receives enough <strong>trace minerals and vitamins</strong> during this stage. While commercial supplements are common, these nutrients can also be sufficiently provided through:
- <strong>Ample quality forage</strong> (such as fresh grass or silage),
- <strong>A small amount of concentrate feed</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>▣ Growth Targets</h2>
<p>The target <strong>daily weight gain differs before and after sexual maturity</strong>:
- <strong>Before sexual maturity</strong>: Aim for ~<strong>600g/day</strong>.
- <strong>After sexual maturity until calving</strong>: Aim for ~<strong>400g/day</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>▣ Types of Roughage Available on Farms</h2>
<p>Farmers can use various types of forage during the rearing phase, such as:
- Wild grasses
- Rice straw
- Fresh forage crops (green feed)
- Silage (ensiled forage)</p>
<hr />
<h2>▣ Nutritional Impact on Growth and Reproduction</h2>
<p>Feed intake level and nutritional quality are <strong>closely linked to body development and future reproductive performance</strong> in heifers. Proper feeding management during the rearing phase leads to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Healthy growth and development</li>
<li>Earlier onset of sexual maturity</li>
<li>Improved conception rates</li>
<li>Higher overall reproductive efficiency</li>
</ul>
<p>If nutritional intake falls <strong>below 20% of standard nutritional requirements</strong>, the onset of sexual maturity may be <strong>delayed by 2–3 months</strong>, increasing the number of non-productive (open) days and resulting in <strong>significant economic loss</strong>.</p>
