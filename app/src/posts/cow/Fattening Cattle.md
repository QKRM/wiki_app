# Fattening Cattle (Beef Cattle)

## Overview

"Fattening cattle" refers to cattle in their growing phase from 6 to 22 months of age, until they are ready for market. Calves exhibit rapid growth after birth, but their growth rate varies depending on genetic factors, climate, feed type and quantity, and management conditions. While growth rate impacts traits such as milking potential, reproductive capacity, and economic lifespan in breeding animals, it is known that growth rate—unless under extreme malnutrition or overnutrition—does not affect mature weight, body size, or productivity in terms of fattening or reproduction.

## Growth Phase (6–12 Months Old)

From 6 to 11 months of age (around 400kg), cattle experience rapid development in bones, internal organs, and digestive system. Feeding guidelines during this stage are as follows:

- Recommended roughage includes hay cubes (0.7–1.2 kg) and rice straw (0.6–1.4 kg).
- Grain mix (CP 11%, TDN 74%) should be fed as flake-type concentrate in limited amounts (6–8 kg).
- Chopping straw to 3 cm improves digestibility.
- For long-term fattening of castrated bulls, using hay or brewery byproduct TMR improves productivity over rice straw feeding.

Longer fattening periods increase feed intake and feed conversion ratio, raising production costs and negatively affecting productivity.

**Key Profitability Factors in Beef Cattle Management:**
1. Genetic potential (bloodline): 40–50%  
2. Environment (housing, weather): 10–15%  
3. Feed quality and type: 15–20%  
4. Management technique: 20–25%

## Enhancing the Feed Value of Rice Straw

- **Ammonia treatment** improves crude protein, digestibility, and TDN.
- Feeding rate improves by 26% in Hanwoo and 18% in dairy cattle.
- Silage quality can be improved with lactic acid additives developed in Korea, increasing feed intake by up to 50%.

---

## Dust Hazards

Excessive dust delays animal growth, increases respiratory infections, and raises harmful bacteria levels.

- **Pelleted feed** is better than powder in dusty areas.
- **NIOSH Limits**:  
  - Inhalable dust: ≤5 mg/m³  
  - Total dust: ≤10 mg/m³  
- Main sources: feed particles, fecal matter, and animal skin/cell debris.
- Dust amount increases with animal density and worsens in dry conditions.
- Effective ventilation systems are necessary.

## Harmful Gases in Livestock Buildings

- **Ammonia (NH₃):**  
  - Safe below 20–25 ppm.  
  - Causes respiratory diseases at higher levels by settling in lower areas.

- **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):**  
  - Odorless, safe below 2,500 ppm.  
  - Max threshold: 5,500 ppm.  
  - Lethal at 300,000 ppm (causes suffocation and death).

- **Hydrogen Sulfide (H₂S):**  
  - Rotten smell, safe below 10 ppm.  
  - Over 20 ppm leads to stress, loss of appetite.  
  - Lethal at 1,000 ppm (eye and throat irritation, unconsciousness, death).

- **Methane (CH₄):**  
  - Safe below 1,000 ppm.  
  - Lethal at 500,000 ppm.  
  - Non-toxic but may cause headaches.
