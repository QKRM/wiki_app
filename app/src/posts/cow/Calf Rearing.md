## Calf Rearing

### Overview

The key objective of calf rearing is to transition from liquid feed to dry feed as early as possible. Newborn calves face many challenges from the outset, including a lack of maternal antibodies, limited immune function, and underdeveloped digestive organs. Therefore, the period within the first month after birth is the most vulnerable, with a high risk of disease and mortality.

Despite the higher labor and feed costs during this time, investing adequately is essential to raise healthy and productive calves. Especially for dairy calves, whose digestive physiology differs significantly from other livestock, careful management based on a sound understanding of their biology is critical.

### Postnatal Care

While in the womb, the calf breathes through the umbilical cord. After birth, the cord detaches and the calf begins breathing through its nose and mouth. Upon exposure to the outside world, mucus around the nostrils and mouth should be cleared immediately to ensure smooth breathing.

If amniotic fluid remains in the nasal cavity or mouth, hold the calf’s hind legs upward to allow fluid to drain. If the calf still cannot breathe, artificial respiration should be performed.

The umbilical cord should be cut with sterilized scissors, leaving 5–6 cm attached. Cutting it too short increases the risk of infection, while too long may cause injury if the calf steps on it. Inject 5–6 cc of iodine into the cord using a needleless syringe, and fully immerse the outside of the cord using a teat-dipping cup to disinfect.

Newborn calves are covered in mucus. Although the mother licks it off, this can take time. In winter, this delay increases the risk of illness. It is recommended to wipe off the mucus with a clean cloth and use infrared heating to maintain room temperature around 25°C. Keep the flooring warm, dry, and well-bedded with clean straw. Avoid exposing the calf to direct cold drafts.

Colostrum should be fed as soon as possible. In some cases, vitamin A, D, E supplements or antibiotics may be injected to reduce stress and prevent pneumonia or diarrhea.

### Colostrum Feeding

To acquire passive immunity, calves must receive colostrum within 6 hours of birth. Delayed feeding decreases absorption efficiency, and if pathogens colonize the intestines before colostrum arrives, the risk of disease and death increases.

Large calves born from difficult labor often struggle to stand quickly, delaying suckling and reducing the absorption of immunoglobulins (Ig), increasing disease susceptibility.

Since natural suckling results in delayed and insufficient intake, it is ideal to separate the calf from the mother immediately after birth and feed fresh, high-quality colostrum early and in sufficient quantity.

- The minimum intake should be **2 liters**, with **1.8–1.9 liters** fed as soon as possible after birth and another dose 12 hours later.
- This totals **approximately 3.8 liters per day**, divided into three feedings.
- Feeding guidelines recommend **5–10% of body weight**, and colostrum should be provided for at least three days to support proper development.

### Estimated Colostrum Requirement

The required volume of colostrum varies depending on the calf's body weight and the IgG content of the colostrum.

To maintain a **minimum IgG level of 10 g/L** in **1L of plasma** for a **40 kg calf** at **24 hours after birth**, the estimated colostrum volume can be calculated as shown below.

### Colostrum Absorption and Feeding Guidelines

The absorption rate of colostrum varies significantly, ranging from 25% to 65%. Some recommend feeding up to 3.6L for the first colostrum intake, as more colostrum means greater antibody intake. Considering this variability, it is important to feed newborn calves small amounts frequently, based on their sucking ability and habits. The goal is to feed as much as possible in a way that suits each calf. Feeding equipment should be cleaned to the same hygiene standards as milking tools.

Ideally, the first colostrum should be given within 30 minutes of birth, and up to 10% of body weight (approximately 4–6kg) should be fed within 14 hours. 

**Basic Feeding Tips:**
1. Once the calf shows improved sucking ability, use a nipple or feeder and allow unrestricted intake.
2. Administer the first batch of colostrum directly from the mother immediately after birth. If the calf struggles to suckle, switch to a softer nipple.
3. Healthy calves can usually consume more than 10% of their body weight on the day of birth. For a 50kg calf, this equates to approximately three 2L feedings.
4. From the second day onward, intake increases, and by two weeks of age, calves can consume over 20% of their body weight—meaning five or more feedings daily.

Feedings should be spaced at regular 6-hour intervals. When feeding 20% of body weight, offer 1.5–2kg per feeding. For 10%, offer 1kg every 6 hours. If the calf shows signs of diarrhea, reduce the amount per feeding and increase frequency. Avoid using bowls or pans for feeding, as they pose safety risks.

### Colostrum Storage and Thawing

- **Refrigeration:** Colostrum can be refrigerated for up to one week before IgG quality deteriorates. Store at 1–2°C to inhibit microbial growth. If a sour odor develops, quality has likely decreased. Use refrigerated colostrum only for short-term storage.
- **Freezing:** Colostrum can be stored for up to a year without IgG breakdown if frozen. Use 1–2L containers or freezer bags at -20°C, and check the temperature regularly. To thaw, avoid denaturing immune components by warming in water no hotter than 50°C.

### Alternatives When Colostrum Is Unavailable

If colostrum is unavailable—such as in the event of dam death—use one of the following substitutes:

- Mix 1 fresh egg with 300mL of boiled water, add 1 teaspoon of castor oil and 600mL of whole milk. Feed 3 times daily for 3–4 days.
- Combine fresh milk with 6 egg whites. Gradually reduce by 1 egg white daily, replacing with whole milk.
- Mix fresh milk with 10g of castor oil, boiled water, and about 2g of salt before feeding.
