## Chapter 3: Reproductive and Udder Health

### Common Reproductive Disorders and Prevention

Proper feeding, exercise, and hygiene are essential to prevent reproductive disorders in breeding cows. The ultimate goal of reproductive management is achieving **one calf per year**.

#### Major Disorders and Causes

- **Ovarian Hypofunction**: Caused by underdeveloped or atrophied ovaries. Improve nutrition by providing quality roughage, protein, phosphorus, and vitamin A. Treatment includes intramuscular injection of PMSG or HCG (500–1,000μg).

- **Ovulation Disorders**: Includes persistent estrus or cystic ovaries, often caused by LH/FSH imbalance. Treated by HCG injection (5,000–10,000 IU).

- **Low Conception Cows**: No detectable anatomical or cycle abnormalities but fail to conceive after three or more attempts. Requires comprehensive feeding, hygiene, and environmental management.

- **Endometritis**: Caused by bacteria (e.g., Vibrio, Brucella, E. coli). Leads to pus in the uterus. Treated by flushing and administering antibiotics.

### Udder Health Management

Udder health is a critical economic factor for productivity and breeding longevity.

#### Clinical Mastitis
- Visibly swollen, hot, painful udder with abnormal milk (e.g., pus).
- Requires immediate treatment to prevent permanent damage or death.

#### Subclinical Mastitis
- No visible signs but confirmed through lab tests (e.g., CMT or bacterial culture).
- Often progresses to clinical mastitis if untreated.
