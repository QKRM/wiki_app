        <h1>Breeding Cows</h1>
<h2>▣ Sexual Maturity</h2>
<p>The onset of sexual maturity in Hanwoo heifers begins during the pubertal period, which occurs as the heifers enter their growing phase. This typically occurs at around 6 to 7 months of age and a body weight of approximately 100 to 120 kg. At this stage, the first estrus (heat) appears, ovarian follicles begin to develop, and ovulation starts.</p>
<p>However, the pubertal period does not indicate readiness for breeding. The period following puberty, known as the sexual maturity phase, typically occurs between 8 to 15 months of age and a weight of 180 to 250 kg. This is when the heifer becomes biologically capable of reproduction. Still, it does not necessarily mean that this is the ideal breeding age.</p>
<p>In general, the optimal breeding age is when the heifer is between 14 to 16 months old and weighs over 250 kg. If a heifer reaches 250 kg at around 12 months and is in good nutritional condition, breeding at that age is usually not problematic.</p>
<h3>What Happens If Breeding Occurs Before Sexual Maturity?</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Poor fetal development</strong>, leading to reduced birth weights and lower calf survival rates.</li>
<li><strong>Underdeveloped mammary glands</strong>, which may lower calf-rearing success even if the calf is born healthy.</li>
<li><strong>Extended postpartum recovery</strong>, which lengthens the reproductive cycle and is economically inefficient.</li>
<li><strong>Increased risk of abortion, dystocia (difficult birth), premature birth, or stillbirth</strong>, which negatively impacts productivity.</li>
</ol>
<p>These issues can contribute to reproductive failure, ultimately shortening the productive lifespan of the cow.</p>

<h2>▣ Estrus and Optimal Insemination Timing</h2>
<p>Effective breeding cow management heavily depends on <strong>accurate estrus detection</strong> and <strong>timely insemination</strong>. When a cow is in estrus, it shows specific behavioral and physical signs that farmers must closely observe. Correct estrus identification helps maintain ideal breeding intervals and enables successful reproductive management.</p>
<h3>Behavioral Signs of Estrus:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>6–10 hours before estrus</strong>: the cow sniffs and licks other cows, allows mounting, and may mount others. While mounting cows are easier to spot, the mounted cow is 65–98% more likely to be in true estrus.</li>
<li>The <strong>vulva becomes moist, reddened, and slightly swollen</strong>. If bleeding is observed, it usually indicates estrus has ended 2–3 days earlier.</li>
</ul>
<h3>During Estrus (about 18 hours):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The cow allows mounting, frequently bellows, appears restless, avoids people slowly, and has decreased appetite.</li>
<li>The vulva becomes even more moist and red, with clear mucus discharge.</li>
<li>Eyes may appear slightly bloodshot.</li>
<li>After estrus, the cow does not allow mounting for about 10 hours, though clear mucus may continue to discharge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Estrus can also be detected through other signs:
- <strong>Mucus discharge</strong>, which is heaviest at the start of estrus and diminishes over time.
- Frequent urination, nervousness, anxiety, decreased appetite.
- Increased walking activity (2–4 times more than normal).
- Loud vocalizations and leaning or licking other cows.</p>
<h3>Importance of Nutrition:</h3>
<p>Proper nutritional levels make estrus detection easier. Since ovulated eggs survive only 6–10 hours, identifying the <strong>optimal time for insemination</strong> is critical. The average estrous cycle in Hanwoo cows is about <strong>21 days</strong>. If estrus is missed, farmers must wait another 21 days, lengthening the breeding interval.</p>
<p>Even after conception, if nutrition is excessive or there are ovarian abnormalities, <strong>false estrus</strong> (pseudo-estrus) may occur. Approximately 10–15% of pregnant cows show signs of false estrus, which requires careful nutritional and reproductive management by the farmer.</p>
