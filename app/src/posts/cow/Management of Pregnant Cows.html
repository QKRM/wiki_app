        <h1>Management of Pregnant Cows</h1>
<h2>▣ General Management</h2>
<p>For the first <strong>six months of pregnancy</strong>, no special management is necessary. Pregnant cows can be fed and cared for in the same way as open (non-pregnant) breeding cows or growing heifers. However, to <strong>prevent early miscarriage</strong>, it is advisable to <strong>avoid any strong physical shocks</strong> during the first 3–4 months.</p>
<h2>▣ Critical Period: 2–3 Months Before Calving</h2>
<p>The most important management phase is <strong>2 to 3 months before calving</strong>, when the <strong>fetus undergoes rapid growth</strong>, accounting for <strong>about 70% of total fetal development</strong>. </p>
<p>During this stage:
- The cow's ability to <strong>redistribute nutrients</strong> to support the fetus becomes insufficient.
- It is necessary to <strong>increase the feed amount by 20–30%</strong> (in terms of <strong>Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN)</strong> and <strong>Crude Protein (CP)</strong>).
- This ensures the birth of a healthy calf with a higher birth weight, ultimately increasing the calf's survival rate.</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<ul>
<li>If a cow was being fed 2–3 kg of concentrate per day, increase the amount by about <strong>1 kg</strong> during this period.</li>
</ul>
<h2>▣ Steaming-Up Feeding Method</h2>
<p>For <strong>first-calf heifers</strong>, it is beneficial to gradually <strong>increase concentrate feed until just before calving</strong> to promote mammary gland development and increase milk yield after calving.<br />
This method is known as the <strong>“steaming-up”</strong> feeding strategy.</p>
<h2>▣ Supplementation Before Calving</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>2 weeks before calving</strong>, feed should be rich in <strong>β-carotene</strong> to help with:</li>
<li>Faster uterine recovery</li>
<li>Earlier return to estrus</li>
<li>Shortened calving interval</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>β-carotene sources</strong> include:
  - Leafy green plants
  - Hay
  - Yellow corn</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fat-soluble vitamins and selenium injections</strong> should also be administered 2 weeks before calving to help prevent:</li>
<li><strong>White muscle disease</strong> in calves</li>
<li><strong>Retained placenta</strong></li>
<li>Stillbirths or abortions in the dam</li>
</ul>
<p>Products containing <strong>Vitamin E and selenium</strong> such as those manufactured by <strong>Schering (USA)</strong> using <strong>sodium selenite</strong> can be used.</p>
<h2>▣ Vaccination Schedule</h2>
<ul>
<li>Conduct <strong>vaccinations twice</strong>:</li>
<li>Once <strong>4 weeks</strong> before calving</li>
<li>Again <strong>2 weeks</strong> before calving</li>
</ul>
<p>This helps protect the newborn calf from viral infections after birth by ensuring sufficient maternal antibodies.</p>
