## Chapter 2: Nutritional and Pregnancy Management

### Feeding Guidelines for Growing and Breeding Cattle

The key to rearing replacement heifers is to provide unlimited high-quality roughage (ad libitum). During the pre-pubertal stage, a daily weight gain of about 500–600g should be maintained to allow sexual maturity around 12–15 months of age.

When purchasing breeding cows externally, priority should be given to selecting animals with healthy and smooth body condition rather than focusing solely on price.

**Feeding principles:**
- Provide abundant quality roughage.
- Use concentrate feed only to supplement nutritional deficiencies.
- Roughage promotes the development of the rumen (1st and 2nd stomachs) and post-rumen digestion.

Lack of roughage may lead to digestive or liver issues, shortening reproductive lifespan. Supplementation of trace minerals and vitamins is also recommended during this stage. Often, these nutrients can be sufficiently provided through a mix of silage or fresh forage and a small amount of concentrate.

**Weight gain goals:**
- Before sexual maturity: ~600g/day
- After sexual maturity to calving: ~400g/day

Example roughages: mountain grass, rice straw, green feed, silage.

Failure to meet proper nutritional standards (20% or more below recommended) may delay sexual maturity by 2–3 months, increasing days open and reducing efficiency.

### Management of Pregnant Cows

From the beginning of pregnancy to about the 6th month, there’s little need to alter standard feeding practices. However, during early pregnancy (first 3–4 months), avoid excessive stress to prevent miscarriage.

The most important period is the **last 2–3 months before calving**, during which:
- Fetal growth accelerates, accounting for ~70% of total weight gain.
- Nutrient requirements increase significantly.
- Increase total digestible nutrients (TDN) and crude protein intake by 20–30%.

For example:
- If concentrate feed was 2–3 kg/day, increase it by 1 kg/day during this time.

**Steaming-up feeding** is recommended for first-calving heifers to promote udder development.

Additional practices:
- Provide β-carotene-rich feed (leafy greens, hay, yellow corn) 2 weeks before calving to assist uterine recovery and promote estrus.
- Inject vitamin E and selenium to prevent white muscle disease in calves and retained placenta in cows.
- Administer two prepartum vaccinations (4 and 2 weeks before delivery) to provide passive immunity to the calf.

### Calving Cow Management

Immediately after calving, check whether the cow is willing and able to nurse. If not:
- Use frozen colostrum sourced from a nearby dairy farm.
- Implement forced or artificial feeding if necessary.

For cows refusing to nurse:
- Provide assistance for 1–3 days to promote natural nursing.
- Switch to bottle or bucket feeding if the calf continues to be rejected.

Keep the cow’s nutrient intake at the same level as just before calving:
- Ensures uterine recovery and supports lactation.

**General postpartum care:**
- Maintain optimal nutrition.
- Encourage daily movement and sunlight exposure to aid vitamin D synthesis and blood circulation.
- This helps promote estrus return and improves uterine recovery.

**Early weaning** is recommended to avoid delays in estrus return:
- Calves consuming at least 500g of milk replacer can be weaned at any time.
- For example, weaning at day 40 can reduce estrus return interval to ~23 days.

### Udder Health Risk Factors

The following diagram illustrates the interrelated factors affecting udder health in breeding cows:

All of these factors contribute to unhealthy udders and elevated risk of mastitis.
