        <h1>Estrus Expression and Observation</h1>
<p>When a cow comes into estrus, the average duration is about <strong>18 to 21 hours</strong>. It is crucial to observe this period accurately. The most effective and practical observation method is to check twice a day (early morning and evening). Around <strong>43% of estrus occurs between midnight and 6 a.m.</strong>, making nighttime observation especially important.</p>
<p>Careful identification of individual cows, proper breeding records, and detailed observation are essential for successful reproductive cow management.</p>

<p>Observation twice a day is highly recommended and can detect estrus in up to 90% of cases. As mentioned earlier, it's more accurate to identify the cow <strong>being mounted</strong> than the one <strong>mounting</strong>.</p>
<p>In small-scale farms where the barn is close to the house, 24-hour monitoring allows for nearly 100% detection accuracy. For larger farms where individual monitoring is difficult, using a <strong>teaser bull</strong> can be very effective.</p>

<h1>Guidelines for Determining Optimal Insemination Time</h1>
<ul>
<li>Estrus typically lasts <strong>18–20 hours</strong>.</li>
<li>Ovulation occurs approximately <strong>8–11 hours after the end of estrus</strong>, or around <strong>29–30 hours after the onset of estrus</strong>.</li>
<li>The lifespan of the ovulated egg is <strong>5–6 hours</strong> (maximum <strong>12–24 hours</strong>).</li>
<li>Sperm can remain viable for <strong>24–40 hours</strong> (up to <strong>50 hours</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ideal insemination timing</strong> is around <strong>18 hours after estrus begins</strong> (late estrus phase).<br />
Best practice:
- If estrus is detected in the morning → inseminate in the late evening.
- If detected in the evening → inseminate the following morning.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Guidelines for Estimating Calving Date</h1>
<p>Many farmers neglect to record insemination dates and expected calving dates, which are essential for proper management. Recording the insemination date allows farmers to:
- Track pregnancy via return to estrus.
- Prepare for calving through accurate expected delivery dates.</p>
<p><strong>Example Calculation</strong>:<br />
Insemination date: March 25, 1998<br />
Expected month: March - 3 = <strong>December</strong><br />
Expected day: 25 + 10 = <strong>January 4, 1999</strong></p>
<hr />
<h1>Estrus Return After Calving</h1>
<p>The average number of days for estrus to return after calving is <strong>50–60 days</strong> (range: <strong>30–90 days</strong>). This period varies by individual and is influenced by:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Uterine Recovery</strong>: Poor nutrition delays estrus return.</li>
<li><strong>Lactation</strong>: Continued suckling causes hormonal changes (oxytocin, prolactin), delaying or weakening estrus. Early weaning can shorten the estrus return period.</li>
<li>After 2–3 months of lactation, the dam’s milk alone cannot meet the calf’s nutritional needs.</li>
<li>By 1 month, the calf’s <strong>TDN</strong> (Total Digestible Nutrients) requirement is 29% unmet.</li>
<li>By 3 months, <strong>CP</strong> (Crude Protein) and <strong>TDN</strong> are short by about 70% and 77%, respectively.</li>
</ol>
<p>➤ Therefore, extending suckling to 3–4 months is not ideal.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Age and Parity</strong>: Younger cows and those with fewer calvings tend to have delayed estrus return. Breeding cows that are not yet sexually mature can shorten their productive lifespan.</li>
</ol>
