## Feeders and drinkers
* Feeders and drinkers are similar, whether being used in free-range, improved freerange systems or small-scale confined systems. They may be linear or tubular

### Linear feed troughs. A rotating handle prevent birds from roosting and defecating in the feeder

* Feeders and drinkers should always be kept clean to prevent spread of diseases.
* They should be big enough for several chicken to feed at the same time. One-meter linear trough or a 35 cm (diameter) tube feeder is big enough for 20 adult birds to eat. A similar diameter of drinker is enough for 40 chicken to drink.
* The feeders can be constructed locally as an activity in the farmer groups. A feeder should have at least the following measurements:
    * 2cm per chick along one side of the linear feeder
    * 5cm per bird for growers and
    * 12cm per bird for adult chicken.
* They should be constructed to meet the following requirements:
    * Easy to clean and fill.
    * It should not allow feed spillage or wastage.
    * It should not allow feed contamination by droppings (faecal matter).

### How to make local Feeders and drinkers
*  Feeders and drinkers may easily be produced out of local materials. For example, an empty tin placed upside down on a plate forms a good drinker. By keeping the tin upside down, you avoid dirt contaminating the water (Figure 17, 18 and 19).
    * Making the drinker:
        * You start by making two small holes near the rim diagonal to each other.
        * Pour clean water in the can.
        * Put a flat plate with a small rim on top and turn the tin and plate upside
down, while pressing them against each other.
        * Gently place the drinker on the ground. The rim of the plate should be low enough for small birds to drink, but also high enough for adult birds to dip their wattles to keep them cool during hot weather.

* Drinkers may be improvised locally from jerrycans by cutting two strips to create openings on one of the broadsides and close the lid. The opening should allow the head of a bird to pass to drink water. Place the jerrycan on the opposite side which is not cut and fill with water.
* Drinkers should not be too deep for chicks to access water and should not allow water spillage in the litter. The drinkers for chicks should be shallow to avoid drowning.
* Commercial feeders and drinkers may also be bought at the market, either in metal or plastic types (Figure 17). They are often expensive and normally not any better than locally produced feeders or drinkers.

* Linear feeders are easy to make from wood, iron sheets or clay. Metallic feeders are easy to clean and disinfect. Wooden feed troughs are cheap but difficult to disinfect.
* It is important that the feeders are constructed in such a way that feed waste is avoided. Also feed waste can be decreased if feeders are not filled to the top. It is better to fill feeders just half full and then check them regularly for refills.
* Linear feeders should have a rotating bar on top to prevent birds from perching and defecating on the feed. The bar also limits the space with feed surface and so preventing birds from entering the feeders and causing wastage by scratching. More examples of how to make linear feeders and their use are shown in pictures below

## Perches
* Perches are important for chickens to rest during night. Perches make the chickens safe, just as they would sleep in trees in the wild.
* Perches will also help the chickens keep their feet clean, since they will not get their feet contaminated in their droppings. Also, the eggs will be cleaner because the chickens will have cleaner legs when they enter the nest
* Parasites may attack poultry resting on the floor, and perches often reduce the risk of external parasites entering the feathers at night.
* To prevent attack of external parasites, the perches may be treated with oil or kerosene, where the perch meets the wall.
* Each one-meter perch may roost five adult birds.
* Perches are best made of bamboo or round sticks to accommodate for the size and structure of the birds’ feet. They should not be too thin or too thick. If the sticks are too big or too small, the birds may fall.

## Nests
In many villages, nests are not provided for the hens and eventually the hens will lay their eggs on the ground or in bush, where they may be difficult to find. Some poultry farmers build nests on the ground outside the chicken houses. This should be avoided, as eggs outside houses are more exposed to predators and thieves. Figure 25 shows a nest with eggs outside a kitchen.

* Nests should be placed inside the chicken house and preferably above the ground.
* The nests for brooding must be individual nests, that only takes one bird at a time. The nest should be placed in a quiet and dark place, on the floor or raised above the ground to avoid dampness and they must be easily removable. Once the hen is broody it is necessary to remove her to a different place, e.g., to another room, to avoid other hens disturbing her, or even going broody as well.

_Nest for broody hens should be placed in a quiet place_

* Simple nests may be clay pots, calabashes or baskets made of local fibres, cardboard, or wooden boxes, cut jerrycans, basins or shallow excavations.
* Nests should be of the right size for the hen to feel comfortable. A nest box will typically measure 30 x 30 x 30 cm. Don’t make them too big, as the hen will not feel comfortable. A calabash or nest basket may measure 40 x 20 x 25 cm (upper diameter x height x lower diameter). A clay pot, more or less the same.

_Simple nests for broody hens should be easily transported_

* A simple and attractive nest for the broody hen may be prepared by following these three steps:
    1. Make sure that the pot or basket is clean and dry;
    2. Fill sand mixed with ashes up to 1/3 of the depth;
    3. Put clean, soft nesting material (hay or straw) on top up to 2/3 of the depth.

* The sand at the bottom of the nest should be covered with enough soft litter about 5-8cm deep. The litter may be old clothes, cotton, dry grass, coffee husks, and any other soft damp-free material.
* Mixing ashes, tobacco leaves or other anti-parasitic substances with the nesting material will keep out most external parasites. External parasites in nests may reduce the hatchability of eggs, as they irritate the hen and it leaves the nest to go and scratch itself often, leaving the eggs cold.
* For several hens laying, you may have a battery of nests where more hens can lay at a time. Nest Boxes made of wood such as in Figure 29 can be constructed. They measure 30cm long by 30cm wide by 25cm high. A hole or cage on this nest caters for a bird.
