# Diseases and health management

* Selection of healthy and sound-looking chicken in the villages or markets is important, if you want to assure a healthy flock and a high productivity. You should therefore know how to judge the quality of different breeds in different ages and sex, based primarily on their looks, vocalizations and behavior.
* In the following, we will introduce simple guidelines on how to select a sound bird at different ages, and introduce what to consider in terms of breed selection.

## Recognizing sick poultry and preventing diseases

* Birds that are well managed, well-fed and vaccinated against the common diseases usually remain healthy and produce well.
* Drugs do not replace good management and are not a guarantee that disease outbreak will not occur.
* When administering drugs, you should always follow the instructions of the manufacturer or veterinary personnel near you. In an outbreak of diseases, always seek assistance from veterinary personnel as most poultry diseases present with general signs and may require further methods for diagnosis.

## Characteristics of healthy and unhealthy chickens
It is very important for the farmer to learn how to detect an unhealthy or sick bird, so he can initiate the right action. In Table 6 below, you will find the main characteristics of healthy and unhealthy birds.

|Healthy birds|Unhealthy birds|
|:---:|:---:|
|![s16213403242025](https://a.okmd.dev/md/67e10822ce892.png)|![s16214403242025](https://a.okmd.dev/md/67e10822b6ac7.png)|
|Alert and on guard|Tired and lifeless, llistlessness, drowsiness|
|Bright eyes and comb|Dull eyes and comb|
|Walk, run, stand, and scratch Continuously|Sit or lie down, droopy wings, body weakness|
|Eat and drink normally|Eat and drink less (anorexia) dehydration, emaciation (loss of weight)|
|Lay eggs normally|Lay less or stop laying eggs|
|Smooth and neat feathers|Ruffled and loose feathers|
|Soft compact droppings|Wet droppings with blood or worms, diarrhea (whitish or greenish faeces which may contain mucous) and dirty/matted feathers around the cloacae (vent).|
|Breath quietly|Increased respiratory rate, laboured breathing, cough, sneeze and breathe noisily, mucous discharge from the mouth and nostrils Bluish-purple (also called cyanosis) combs and skin due to oxygen deficiency in the blood|
|Normal wattles, sinuses, leg and wing joints|Swollen wattles, sinuses, leg or wing joints, footpads & sternal bursa.|
|No shivering|Fever as shown by shivering|
|Normal posture of the head or the body|Neck tilting (Torticollis), convulsions and tremors.|
||Sudden death|

_It is important to isolate unhealthy or sick birds from the healthy flock in order to ensure minimum of losses. If you find an unhealthy or sick bird, isolate the chicken and call for the veterinarian or health assistant for disease identification and further advice. If the bird dies, burn it or bury it. You should remove dead birds, so that the germs are not left on the ground to be passed on to other birds._


## Disease types

Diseases of chicken can be classified according to causes into viral bacterial, parasitic, fungal and other disorders (nutritional, poisoning). The different types of diseases have different control or cure methods, as described in the Table.

|Disease type|Possibilites for control or cure|
|:---:|:---:|
|Virus|Viral diseases cannot be cured, but may be prevented or controlled if the animals are vaccinated before the disease occurs in the flock. If the disease is present in the flock, vaccinations might increase the severity of the disease, ultimately killing the birds. So, DO NOT vaccinate sick birds.|
|Bacterial|Many bacterial diseases can be treated with the use of antibiotics. It is important to diagnose the disease in order to choose the right antibiotic.|
|Parasites|Most parasites can be treated with traditional and conventional medicines (anthelmintics = dewormers).|
|Fungus|Fungal diseases might be treated with antibiotics.|
|Nutiritional diseases/disorders|Nutritional diseases or disorders are caused by a wrong feed composition. Depending on the disease it can be prevented by mixing the right feed with minerals and vitamins, or  iving access to a diversity of feedstuffs from the surroundings, e.g., green grass and fresh cow dung.|

## Important diseases of local chicken in Uganda

The common infectious diseases of local poultry reported in Uganda are Newcastle disease, Fowl pox, Gumboro disease, colibacillosis, and other bacterial infections. Some other diseases have not been reported in local chicken but they cannot be ruled out due to scarcity of veterinary and diagnostic services in the rural areas. Some of them have been described in this manual but the owner is advised to consult a veterinarian before treatment. The parasitic diseases include coccidiosis, roundworms and tapeworm infestations and external parasites like mites and fleas. Nutritional deficiency, especially vitamin and mineral deficiencies have been reported.

## Common means of spread of the disease

Diseases can be spread by introducing sick birds into the flock or by persons, their foot wears/clothing
or even on vehicles used transport chicken and their products. A pictorial illustration of diseases is
shown in Figure below.

If a few chickens survive, they will become carriers for some time, likely to infect new birds.&lt;br&gt; • A high standard of sanitation should be practiced and avoid the introduction of disease in the flock.&lt;br&gt; • Do not keep chickens and guinea fowl together as they are healthy carriers and can transmit the disease to poultry.&lt;br&gt; • Newcastle Disease is a reportable disease. All suspected outbreaks of the disease must be reported to animal health authorities immediately.</td>

### NOTE :

* Most of the infectious diseases present with general signs and so post-mortem examination is very useful in disease diagnosis. Seek the help of a veterinarian near you.
* Birds should not be slaughtered before the withdrawal period of the drugs for human consumption. Follow the manufacturers’ instruction about withdrawal period and dosage of drug for the given condition you are treating.
* Most drugs come in trade names, so you should find from the drug seller the true drug name for the right treatment.
