<h1>Diseases and health management</h1>
<ul>
<li>Selection of healthy and sound-looking chicken in the villages or markets is important, if you want to assure a healthy flock and a high productivity. You should therefore know how to judge the quality of different breeds in different ages and sex, based primarily on their looks, vocalizations and behavior.</li>
<li>In the following, we will introduce simple guidelines on how to select a sound bird at different ages, and introduce what to consider in terms of breed selection.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recognizing sick poultry and preventing diseases</h2>
<ul>
<li>Birds that are well managed, well-fed and vaccinated against the common diseases usually remain healthy and produce well.</li>
<li>Drugs do not replace good management and are not a guarantee that disease outbreak will not occur.</li>
<li>When administering drugs, you should always follow the instructions of the manufacturer or veterinary personnel near you. In an outbreak of diseases, always seek assistance from veterinary personnel as most poultry diseases present with general signs and may require further methods for diagnosis.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Characteristics of healthy and unhealthy chickens</h2>
<p>It is very important for the farmer to learn how to detect an unhealthy or sick bird, so he can initiate the right action. In Table 6 below, you will find the main characteristics of healthy and unhealthy birds.</p>

|Alert and on guard|Tired and lifeless, llistlessness, drowsiness|
|Bright eyes and comb|Dull eyes and comb|
|Walk, run, stand, and scratch Continuously|Sit or lie down, droopy wings, body weakness|
|Eat and drink normally|Eat and drink less (anorexia) dehydration, emaciation (loss of weight)|
|Lay eggs normally|Lay less or stop laying eggs|
|Smooth and neat feathers|Ruffled and loose feathers|
|Soft compact droppings|Wet droppings with blood or worms, diarrhea (whitish or greenish faeces which may contain mucous) and dirty/matted feathers around the cloacae (vent).|
|Breath quietly|Increased respiratory rate, laboured breathing, cough, sneeze and breathe noisily, mucous discharge from the mouth and nostrils Bluish-purple (also called cyanosis) combs and skin due to oxygen deficiency in the blood|
|Normal wattles, sinuses, leg and wing joints|Swollen wattles, sinuses, leg or wing joints, footpads &amp; sternal bursa.|
|No shivering|Fever as shown by shivering|
|Normal posture of the head or the body|Neck tilting (Torticollis), convulsions and tremors.|
||Sudden death|</p>
<p><em>It is important to isolate unhealthy or sick birds from the healthy flock in order to ensure minimum of losses. If you find an unhealthy or sick bird, isolate the chicken and call for the veterinarian or health assistant for disease identification and further advice. If the bird dies, burn it or bury it. You should remove dead birds, so that the germs are not left on the ground to be passed on to other birds.</em></p>
<h2>Disease types</h2>
<p>Diseases of chicken can be classified according to causes into viral bacterial, parasitic, fungal and other disorders (nutritional, poisoning). The different types of diseases have different control or cure methods, as described in the Table.</p>
<p>|Disease type|Possibilites for control or cure|
|:---:|:---:|
|Virus|Viral diseases cannot be cured, but may be prevented or controlled if the animals are vaccinated before the disease occurs in the flock. If the disease is present in the flock, vaccinations might increase the severity of the disease, ultimately killing the birds. So, DO NOT vaccinate sick birds.|
|Bacterial|Many bacterial diseases can be treated with the use of antibiotics. It is important to diagnose the disease in order to choose the right antibiotic.|
|Parasites|Most parasites can be treated with traditional and conventional medicines (anthelmintics = dewormers).|
|Fungus|Fungal diseases might be treated with antibiotics.|
|Nutiritional diseases/disorders|Nutritional diseases or disorders are caused by a wrong feed composition. Depending on the disease it can be prevented by mixing the right feed with minerals and vitamins, or  iving access to a diversity of feedstuffs from the surroundings, e.g., green grass and fresh cow dung.|</p>
<h2>Important diseases of local chicken in Uganda</h2>
<p>The common infectious diseases of local poultry reported in Uganda are Newcastle disease, Fowl pox, Gumboro disease, colibacillosis, and other bacterial infections. Some other diseases have not been reported in local chicken but they cannot be ruled out due to scarcity of veterinary and diagnostic services in the rural areas. Some of them have been described in this manual but the owner is advised to consult a veterinarian before treatment. The parasitic diseases include coccidiosis, roundworms and tapeworm infestations and external parasites like mites and fleas. Nutritional deficiency, especially vitamin and mineral deficiencies have been reported.</p>
<h2>Common means of spread of the disease</h2>
<p>Diseases can be spread by introducing sick birds into the flock or by persons, their foot wears/clothing
or even on vehicles used transport chicken and their products. A pictorial illustration of diseases is
shown in Figure below.</p>

<em>Transporting infected chickens will spread the Newcastle disease and other contagious infectious disease to other chickens</em></p>
<h2>Infectious diseases</h2>
<p>|Disease name|Detail|
|---|---|
|Newcastle Disease| • ND is the commonest chicken disease in homesteads in Uganda.<br>• It affects all age groups with high death rates (30-80%) and is most common in the dry season, particularly the January to March.<br>• The disease spreads mainly through oral and respiratory discharges and droppings of infected birds. Other ways of spread can be|
|Cause|Virus|
|Signs and symptoms|• Loss of appetite, droopy wings, dullness and birds hide their heads under the wings.<br>• Greenish-yellow and sometimes bloody diarrhoea<br>• Respiratory signs such as noisy breathing,sneezing, coughing and gasping.<br>• Discharges from nostrils and eyes<br>• Muscular abnormalities like twisted neck Figure 43, stiffness and prostration.<br>• Central nervous signs like tremors, compulsive movements, and death.<br>• Drops in egg laying. Eggs are of low quality and may be soft-shelled, roughened, or deformed. Production resumes slowly, or not at all, depending on the stage of lay at the time of infection<br>• High death rates|
|Prevention|• Vaccination is the only way to control ND. A vaccination program should be adopted and strictly adhered to<br>• Avoid introducing new birds into your stock. If new birds are nevertheless introduced, a two-week quarantine period should be applied.<br> • If any birds are affected, get rid of the whole flock. If a few chickens survive, they will become carriers for some time, likely to infect new birds.<br> • A high standard of sanitation should be practiced and avoid the introduction of disease in the flock.<br> • Do not keep chickens and guinea fowl together as they are healthy carriers and can transmit the disease to poultry.<br> • Newcastle Disease is a reportable disease. All suspected outbreaks of the disease must be reported to animal health authorities immediately.|
|Treatment|• No treatment as it is a viral disease|</p>
<p>|Disease name|Detail|
|---|---|
|Fowl Pox|• Spread by contact. <br> • Birds of all ages can be affected but it’s of more danger to chicks and laying birds|
|Cause|Virus|
|Signs and symptoms| • Wart-like nodules/ scabs are common on combs, wattles and around the eye/ base of the beaks. Eyelids can be closed by these nodules (cutaneous form). Another form attacks the mouth or upper airways, where white nodules are seen in the mouth, tongue, throat, nostrils, and eyes. This causes more deaths as the birds cannot eat and/or drink.<br><img alt="s10354603252025" src="https://a.okmd.dev/md/67e208755a000.png" /><br>• Drop in egg production.<br>• Death rate with fowl pox is generally low and deaths are mainly due to
suffocation and starvation.|
|Prevention|• Vaccination is recommended and highly effective. Usually done at 4 – 8 weeks of age. See vaccination Chapter for a detailed explanation on how to vaccine against fowl pox.|
|Treatment|• No specific treatment for fowl pox since it is a viral disease.<br>• However, removing the scabs on the head with cotton wool moistened in iodine and giving Oxytetracycline 25% in drinking water for 5 days improves survival.|</p>
<p>|Disease name|Detail|
|---|---|
|Gumboro disease (Infectious Bursal Disease,IBD)|• Usually occurs in large flocks kept in confinement. Not common in small-scale village-based systems.<br>• However, the disease is of increasing importance these days in chicks of local poultry <br>• Generally, it occurs in chicks between 3 – 6 weeks of age.<br>• Mainly affects the gland called the bursa of Fabricius which is one of the most important immune organs located around the cloaca<br> • The disease can be spread by contact with contaminated materials and through various parasites that pick up and carry the virus.|
|Cause|Virus|
|Signs and symptoms|• Signs observed only after 3 weeks of age. Sudden and high morbidity rate. The number of affected birds is very high in the flock<br>• The number of deaths is usually low although it can be substantial (approaching 90%) if husbandry is poor. Death in a flock usually peak and recedes within a week of onset.<br>• Diarrhoea that may be white but occasionally, <br>• there is passing of blood and straining during<br>• defecation.<br>• Depression, lack of appetite, ruffled feathers,<br>• and a droopy appearance.<br>• Vent pecking is common.<br>• Post-mortem is required to establish the actual diagnosis of the disease by the veterinarian.|
|Prevention|Vaccination|
|Treatment|• No specific treatment available as it is a viral disease. <br>• However, good husbandry like adequate temperature and broad-spectrum antibiotics may reduce the severity of the disease.|</p>
<p>|Disease name|Detail|
|---|---|
|Infectious Bronchitis (IB)|• Spread rapidly and can affect 100% of birds in a flock with varying severity.|
|Cause|Virus|
|Signs and symptoms|• Gasping, coughing and sneezing<br>• Discharges from nose and eyes.<br>• In chicks: weakness, depression, and huddling near heat sources. Mortality in young chicks is usually negligible unless the disease is complicated by another infectious agent like bacteria. In laying birds, egg production decreases (up to 50%) and eggs have ragged shapes. Effects on production can last 6-8 weeks or longer.<br><img alt="s10565203252025" src="https://a.okmd.dev/md/67e20d8923d89.png" />|
|Prevention|• Vaccination. Vaccines are either separate or combined with that for Newcastle disease.|
|Treatment|• No specific treatment, as it is a viral disease.<br> • A broad-spectrum antibiotic can help because the disease is usually complicated by bacterial infections.<br> • For baby chicks with the disease, it may be helpful to increase the room temperature, encourage the birds to eat and correct any apparent management deficiencies.|</p>
<p>|Disease name|Detail|
|---|---|
|Colibacillosis(Navel ill)|• Disease of poor hygiene.<br>• Spreads through fecal contamination. Birds infected by direct contact with dirty litter or contaminated eggshells. Not transmitted from bird to bird.|
|Cause|• Environmental disease caused by common bacteria, present in the intestine of birds and mammals|
|Signs and symptoms|• Common among newly hatched chicks: infection in the stomach region.<br> • Symptoms in older birds<br>» respiratory distress<br>» infection in the egg organ with stop of egg production<br>» enlarged and swollen navel<br>» diarrhea with the pasting of feathers around the vent.<br><img alt="s11010403252025" src="https://a.okmd.dev/md/67e20e62b6853.png" />|
|Prevention|• Vigorous sanitation program in the poultry house and control dust in the poultry house.<br>• Avoid stress from other diseases and parasites.<br>• Clean and disinfect waterers and feeders and avoid fecal contamination of these.|
|Treatment|• Treatment of sick chicks might be possible with antibiotics (tetracyclines,enrofloxacin, neomycin, sulfa drugs and others).<br>• Treatment is usually effective if given early.|</p>
<p>|Title|Detail|
|---|---|
|Brooder pneumonia (Aspergillosis)|• Acquired by breathing in (inhalation) of fungal spores from mouldy feed or litter.<br>• Not transmitted from bird to bird.|
|Cause|Fungus|
|Signs and symptoms|Disease attacks lungs, air sacs and liver. Signs include difficulty in breathing, gasping, blindness and abnormal behaviour when the brain gets involved.|
|Prevention|• Good ventilation in the house where birds sleep or are reared.<br>• Litter should always be dry and friable. Caked litter should be removed to prevent the growth of fungus.<br>• A fresh feed should be fed. Do not give mouldy feed to the birds.<br>• Use Copper Sulphate following manufacturer guides to decontaminate the litter.|</p>
<h3>NOTE :</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most of the infectious diseases present with general signs and so post-mortem examination is very useful in disease diagnosis. Seek the help of a veterinarian near you.</li>
<li>Birds should not be slaughtered before the withdrawal period of the drugs for human consumption. Follow the manufacturers’ instruction about withdrawal period and dosage of drug for the given condition you are treating.</li>
<li>Most drugs come in trade names, so you should find from the drug seller the true drug name for the right treatment.</li>
