## Why should poultry have houses or shelters?
Housing is essential to protect chicken against
* predators (like snakes, eagles and wild animals). Young chicken are the most affected
* thieves,
* bad weather (rain, sun, very cold winds, dropping night temperatures) (Figure 4) and
* to provide shelter for egg-laying and broody hens.

A suitable or comfortable poultry house is also important for efficient production and convenience of
the poultry farmer

The major causes of death or losses of local chicken in the homesteads are:
* Diseases
* bad weather
* predators
* accidents
* thieves

House contributes greatly to controlling these causes of death so that we get more chicken that
survive for food and income.

## Choosing the right site
When choosing the right site, you should consider

* A shady area to keep the house cool. Tall trees close to the houses provide shade and
are therefore beneficial. Trees serve as a windbreak and for shade in the dry seasons.
The disadvantage is that it allows flying predators to perch nearby.
* A dry raised place with a flat ground to keep the floor dry during the rainy season.
* A well-drained soil is desired. Do not build a house in a swamp or where rain water can
enter the house. Water in chicken houses causes release of toxic gas, called ammonia,
and germs to grow.
* Clear the grass and bushes for about 3 meters on all sides of the house to keep snakes
and rats away from your chickens.
* Build chicken house near the human house for security reasons. You must be able to
hear if chickens get disturbed at night by predators, or a thief who wants to steal the
birds.
* The house should be built in a way that direct sunrays do not enter the house. This is
important for the brooder where the local chicks will stay indoors for about 2 months
before going out. This is called east-west orientation of a rectangular chicken house.
Direct sun rays promote overplaying and so dust environment from litter results into
respiratory diseases. Figure 5 and 6 illustrate a bad and a well-constructed chicken
house.

## Chicken runs
* Runs are enclosed areas around chicken houses that allows chicken to stay when outside
the house.
* Fenced areas are also used for feeding, watering, observation of the flock, and collection
of eggs (Figure 8).
* Walls of 1.5 â€“ 2-meter high made of clay or woven mat may be used to construct fences.

Programmed Hatching Management Method - PAMANA PROJECT
* A chicken run is relatively costly, but may provide a sort of security to the farmer and is
a good occasion to observe the behavior of the birds and detect possible problems.
* It is however crucial that adult birds are left scavenging outside during daytime in order
to keep feed costs low.

## Shelters for the mother hen and chicks
* After hatching, it is important to keep the hen and the chicks close together in a
separate cage or room.
* The simplest solution is to use the basket (Figure 9). Such a shelter should primarily
protect against adult poultry competing for feed, and against predators, and it should
provide a stable environment, sheltering from sun, rain, and wind.

## Brooder
* The brooder is the house for raising chicks up to 8 weeks of life.
* A brooder is built to keep the house warm for chicks to live comfortably. It should not
get cold very fast and should be properly sealed so as not to allow in cold air. It should
not also allow too much heat to build up inside.
* It has adequate ventilation i.e., windows and ventilators can be opened or closed when
necessary
Note: Young chicks are very vulnerable to cold, dehydration, starvation and diseases, so care
should be taken to avoid these.

## Rearing House
* This is a house used for keeping birds after leaving the brooder up to old age.
* Such houses are important in places like camps where land sizes are small and chicken
need to be kept indoors to minimize thefts and conflicts.
* The house should have adequate ventilation by constructing a short wall (about
0.5meters high) and the remaining height made of wire mesh or woven reeds

## Litter
* Various types of materials used as litter include (Figure 13):
    * coffee husks,
    * wood shavings/saw dust,
    * rice husks,
    * crushed groundnut haulms, and
    * chopped maize/sorghum stalks among others.
* The floor should be covered with at least 3-inch-thick litter.
* The litter should not be mouldy. It should be kept dry and friable by replacing wet parts and
raking daily.

## Management of poultry houses
The underlying principle is to keep the house tidy, clean and safe for birds. Management practices
include:
* Cleaning the area around poultry house
* Removing any dead birds found in the house, burying or burning immediately. They
should not be thrown in a rubbish pit.
* Keeping unnecessary visitors away from poultry units.
* Carrying out routine repairs on the house as depreciation sets in with time.
* Fencing off the poultry houses with materials such as natural trees, wire mesh or
traditional fences of woods and reeds, whichever is possible.

## Stores (for feeds, eggs, and equipment)
* This could also be a house (or room) for storing farm harvests.
* The feed store should be a room or a house that does not leak and minimizes entry of
rats.
* The wall should be plastered and the finishing made with a slippery layer of cement
(or any slippery material) to avoid rodents from climbing and parasites hiding in
them.
* The door should also be fitted firmly.
* The store should have slates or raised structures on which feed/egg trays are packed to
avoid contact with the floor (see Figure 14). Sacks of food should be packed in stacks
with spaces between them for air circulation.
* You should always avoid the use of rat poison in the store as it can contaminate the
feed. Resort to traps or cats.

## Sickbay/ Isolation room
* Have a separate house where sick chicken can be isolated and treated. You could also
have a separate room to quarantine new chicken brought from another farm to your
home.
* In the sickbay, you keep birds which you suspect to be sick, unproductive and injured
e.g., by accident or wild animals. At times sick ones can be kept in an isolation unit
or sickbay from where they can be watched closely and treated or culled in case of a
contagious disease.
* Birds that are very sick should be disposed of as they may not regain their production
ability to the maximum.
