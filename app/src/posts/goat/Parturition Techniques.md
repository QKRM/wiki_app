# 2. Parturition Techniques

## □ Estimating Due Date

Because most goats breed naturally without precise individual tracking, it is often difficult to determine the exact date of mating. However, if mating is witnessed, the expected due date can be calculated (average gestation: 150 days) and recorded on a breeding chart. When the due date approaches, the pregnant goat should be moved to a clean birthing pen to help prevent birthing accidents.

In most cases where the mating date is unknown, caretakers must carefully observe the following **signs of impending labor**:

- The udder becomes significantly enlarged.
- The vulva swells, and mucus begins to discharge from the vagina.
- The goat urinates frequently in small amounts and defecates more often.
- It may bleat frequently.
- The goat appears restless, scratching and gathering bedding materials to make a nest.
- The abdomen drops, muscles around the hips and loin become loose, and the area around the base of the tail becomes visibly sunken.

## □ Labor and Delivery

Goats usually give birth without assistance and go through labor naturally. Although it may seem distressing, caretakers should avoid interfering and simply observe unless necessary.

Most deliveries are smooth, but **dystocia (difficult birth)** can occur in the following cases:
- Weak contractions
- Oversized fetus
- Narrow birth canal
- Twins trying to exit at the same time
- Abnormal fetal positioning

The **normal position** is head-first presentation. If a kid presents rear-first (breech), assistance is required.

Failure to detect and assist in time can result in the death of the fetus, and even the mother. In such cases, the caretaker should seek help from a veterinarian or someone experienced—or intervene personally if necessary.

**Assistance procedure**:
- Wash hands with soapy water and disinfect.
- Apply lubricating oil.
- Gently insert the hand into the birth canal to identify the cause of dystocia.
- If the position is abnormal, carefully push the fetus back into the uterus and reposition it.
- During contractions, slowly assist in pulling the kid out.
- In cases of weak labor, administering **oxytocin** or small amounts of **alcohol** may help stimulate contractions.

**Important:**
A mother goat recognizes her kid primarily by **smell**. If this bond is not established, the mother may reject the kid, potentially leading to starvation. To prevent this, ensure the mother has the chance to smell and bond with her newborn.

Newborns are born enclosed in the amniotic sac. Usually, the mother will lick and tear away the sac, but **first-time mothers** or fatigued does may fail to do so. If not removed, the kid may **suffocate**. Thus, it’s crucial to supervise every birth.

After birth:
- Immediately **wipe the amniotic fluid** from the kid’s mouth and body.
- In cold weather, failure to dry the newborn can result in **hypothermia**. Use a **towel or hair dryer** to dry the kid thoroughly.
- Ensure the kid consumes **colostrum** from the mother and **confirm it is nursing**.
- It is recommended to prepare a **separate pen** for the kid and return it after feeding to encourage safe bonding and rest.


## □ Number of Kids per Birth and Pre-Weaning Mortality Rate

Goats are more likely to give birth to **two or more kids** rather than just one.

## □ Number of Kids per Birth and Pre-Weaning Mortality Rate

In goats, the frequency of giving birth to a **single kid** is about **40%**, while **twin births** account for approximately **50%**. **Triplet births** occur in about **8%**, and **quadruplet births** in around **1%** of cases. In extremely rare cases, goats may give birth to **five kids**.

The **average litter size** in goats is approximately **1.7 kids per birth**.

Despite their reproductive capability, goats have a **relatively high pre-weaning mortality rate of 23%**. This is largely due to the lack of individual management, especially in **pasture-based systems**.

Notably, **single-kid births** have the **highest pre-weaning mortality rate**, primarily because they are more common in **first-time mothers (primiparous does)**, who may be less experienced in caring for their offspring.

## □ Postpartum Management

- Normally, the **afterbirth (placenta)** is expelled **within 30 minutes to 1 hour** after delivery. If it is not expelled, the doe may develop **puerperal fever**, so close observation is necessary.

- After birth, the mother goat typically **licks the mucus** off the kid's body as part of natural maternal behavior. However, if the mother is **exhausted**, has **multiple kids**, or **does not clean the kid**, the caretaker must wipe the kid with a **dry towel**, starting with the **nostrils**, then the **mouth**, **neck**, and **body** to help maintain **body temperature** and **prevent respiratory issues**.

- As the mother is usually fatigued after delivery, it is helpful to offer her **bran mixed with warm water and a pinch of salt** to aid recovery.

- A **healthy newborn kid** will usually find the mother's udder and start nursing **within 10 to 20 minutes**. If it fails to do so, the caretaker should gently assist by **holding the kid with the left hand** and guiding the **teat into the mouth with the right hand**.

- If the kid does **not consume colostrum within the first hour**, especially in **cold weather or during nighttime births**, it may suffer from **hypothermia** and **starvation**, which can be fatal.

- Since newborn kids cannot control their body well immediately after birth, **take precautions to prevent them from being stepped on** by the mother or other goats.

- If **vaginal or uterine prolapse** occurs after birth, make sure that the exposed tissue does **not get contaminated**. If contamination is suspected:
  - Rinse the tissue with **clean water or disinfectant**
  - Wrap it in a **clean cloth**
  - **Contact a veterinarian immediately**

- The **kidding area** must be kept **clean, well-ventilated, and hygienic** to prevent infections and ensure a safe recovery environment for both the doe and the kids.
