<h1>1. Overview</h1>
<p>Goat breeds can be broadly classified according to their purposes into dairy breeds, fiber breeds, and meat breeds. Dairy breeds include Saanen, British Saanen, Japanese Saanen, Toggenburg, Alpine, Nubian, and Nonsan dairy goats. Fiber breeds include Angora and Cashmere goats. Meat breeds include Japanese native breeds and Chinese native goats, along with various regional native goats raised locally.</p>
<h1>2. Dairy Breeds</h1>
<h2>□ Saanen</h2>
<p>The Saanen breed is the most representative and widely distributed dairy goat breed in the world. Originating from the Saanen Valley in the Canton of Bern, Switzerland, it has spread globally since the 1930s through the United States and Europe. </p>
<p>They have glossy, short, white or creamy-white hair that closely adheres to the body. Both males and females have beards, with males having longer and fuller beards. They have large bodies, medium-sized heads with broad foreheads, yellow eyes, white eyebrows, erect ears, and yellow hooves. </p>
<p>Females have wide chests and horizontal backs with broad rumps. Their udders are elongated and attached to the abdomen, with teats slanting outward—this is considered desirable. Overall, their body shape is a long triangle, characteristic of dairy animals.</p>
<p>An excellent Saanen can produce around 2,000 kg of milk during the lactation period (270–350 days), with typical averages ranging from 500 to 1,000 kg. Peak daily milk production can reach 3–5 kg, and the average daily yield is about 2 kg.</p>
<p>Weights are approximately 50–65 kg for females and 70–90 kg for males. Height is about 75 cm for females and 85 cm for males. The Saanen breed has served as the genetic foundation for other dairy breeds such as the British Saanen, German Saanen, and Japanese Saanen.</p>
<h2>□ British Saanen</h2>
<p>The British Saanen is an improved breed created by crossbreeding the British native goat with the Saanen breed. Its coat is white, short, and glossy. Compared to the pure Saanen, it has longer legs, a larger frame, and superior milk production.</p>
<p>It was officially recognized as a breed in 1925 by the British Goat Society. This breed is known for its docile temperament and ability to thrive in rough terrain. While similar in appearance to the Saanen, its total milk yield is around 2,600 kg, with an average daily production of 6–8 kg and a butterfat content of approximately 3.48%. It has been exported to various European countries and has contributed to goat breeding improvements.</p>
<h2>□ Japanese Saanen</h2>
<p>The Japanese Saanen was developed by repeatedly crossbreeding native goats from the Kyushu region of Japan with either male or female Saanen goats. It was officially named "Japanese Saanen" upon the establishment of the Japan Goat Association in 1949.</p>
<p>In appearance, it closely resembles the Saanen. The average height is about 75 cm for females and 85 cm for males. Average weights are approximately 52 kg for females and 64 kg for males. The total milk yield is around 300–500 kg, with a lactation period of 150–250 days.</p>

<h2>□ Toggenburg</h2>
<p>The Toggenburg breed originates from the Toggenburg Valley in northeastern Switzerland. Its coat is fawn or chocolate in color, with short to medium-length hair that lies flat against the body. The ears have white markings around or at the tips, and two distinct white stripes run from above the eyes to the muzzle.</p>
<p>The breed has a broad head, relatively large eyes, and upright ears. The inner sides of the legs, as well as the lower parts of the forearms and pasterns, are all white. A white triangular patch is also present on one side of the tail.</p>
<p>In terms of size, females weigh around 45–50 kg, and males weigh between 60–80 kg. The height is slightly smaller than that of the Alpine breed, with females standing at about 70 cm and males at around 90 cm.</p>
<p>Toggenburg goats have well-developed udders and teats, although their milk production is slightly lower than that of the Saanen breed. The lactation period lasts between 240–280 days, with a total milk yield of about 600–700 kg and a butterfat content of 3.7%.</p>

<h2>□ French Alpine</h2>
<p>The French Alpine is an improved breed derived from native goats widely raised in the mountainous regions of the French Alps and Switzerland. The breed does not have a fixed coat color and may appear in white, brown, black, red, or any combination of these colors.</p>
<p>They are known for their docile temperament, robust health, and suitability for breeding in mountainous terrains. </p>
<p>Females weigh around 60 kg, and males about 75 kg. The height is approximately 75 cm for females and 85–100 cm for males.</p>
<p>The lactation period lasts about 280–300 days. The average daily milk yield is 2.37 kg, with a total milk yield of around 1,600 kg.</p>
<p>Additionally, the British Alpine breed, which was developed by crossbreeding the French Alpine with the Toggenburg, is known to have better milk production capabilities than the Saanen.</p>

<h2>□ Nubian</h2>
<p>The Nubian breed originated from the Nubia region in northeastern Africa and is commonly raised in countries such as Nubia, Egypt, and Ethiopia. It is also bred in Europe, India, and the United States. Also known as the "Egyptian goat," its coat color is highly variable and can be reddish-brown, chestnut, creamy white, black, or a mix of these colors.</p>
<p>The breed has a short, broad head and large, drooping ears. Both males and females have a similar height, around 60–70 cm. Nubians are gentle in temperament but are not well-suited for breeding in cold and humid climates.</p>
<p>The average daily milk yield is around 3–4 kg, and the milk has a very high butterfat content, ranging from 4% to 7%.</p>
