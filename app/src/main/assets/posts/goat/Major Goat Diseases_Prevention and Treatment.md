# 1. Observation, Diagnosis, and Disease Prevention

Goats often **hide signs of illness**, making it difficult to detect early symptoms. In many cases, illness is not noticed until the condition becomes severe, at which point **treatment may be less effective**. 

Therefore, **early detection** through regular observation is essential. However, even more important is **preventing disease** through proper feeding, management, and hygiene.

## □ Guidelines for Health Monitoring in Goats

A goat’s health can be assessed through **careful daily observation** of various physical and behavioral indicators. The following signs should be checked regularly by the caretaker:

- **Mobility** (any limping or stiffness)
- **Appetite** (reduced feed or water intake)
- **Coat condition** (shine, texture, or patchy loss)
- **Body weight changes**
- **Condition of feces and urine** (consistency, frequency, presence of blood or mucus)
- **Eyes** (clarity, presence of discharge, cloudiness)
- **Body temperature**
- **Hooves** (overgrowth, foul odor, lameness)
- **Wounds or swelling**
- **Nasal discharge or sniffling**
- **Tearing or abnormal eye discharge**

> ⚠️ Regular and systematic observation allows for **early detection and treatment**, which is critical to maintaining herd health and reducing mortality.

## □ Goat Health Observation Checklist

| Observation Category | Description | Notes |
|----------------------|-------------|-------|
| **Mobility**         | Movement reaction, limping, stiffness | Observe constantly |
| **Appetite**         | Normal intake, palatability, chewing, feeding behavior | Based on daily intake standards |
| **Hair (Skin), Hooves** | Gloss, hair loss, injuries | Check weekly |
| **Eyes, Nose**       | Discharge, tearing, nasal mucus | Look for inflammation and color changes |
| **Body Temperature** | Normal, fever | Normal range: **38.5–39.5°C** |
| **Feces/Urine**      | Color, frequency, consistency | Note any unusual odor |
| **Body Weight**      | Below or above standard | Based on age-specific standards |
| **Environment**      | Temperature, humidity | Optimal: **10–18°C**, max **27°C**; Humidity: **60–80%** |

# 2. Disease Prevention and Common Goat Diseases

## □ Disease Prevention

- Provide goats with **nutrient-rich feed** and allow as much **pasture grazing** as possible to let them eat their preferred forage.
- Keep the **goat shed dry** to prevent dampness. In winter, block cold drafts and maintain warmth while ensuring ventilation. In summer, ensure **good airflow** and cooling.
- Protect goats from **mosquito bites**, especially in summer.
- Ensure goats receive **adequate exercise**.
- Administer **dewormers in spring and autumn**, and **disinfect barns and paddocks** regularly to prevent parasitic infections.

## □ Common Goat Diseases and Treatments

### ○ Acute Bloat (Ruminal Tympany)
- **Cause**: Spoiled or fermented feed, rain-soaked forage, excessive legumes, sudden feed changes (often in summer).
- **Symptoms**: Swollen left abdomen, no rumination, difficulty breathing.
- **Treatment**:
  - *Mild*: Place a stick or wooden piece in the mouth to promote gas release; give 3 mL hydrochloric acid + 3–9 mL ethyl alcohol diluted in 5 parts water.
  - *Severe*: Insert a trocar or tube into the left abdomen to release gas, then administer anti-fermentation agents (e.g., Gastrit, Gasmin, Gasmine).
- **Prevention**: Avoid feeding large amounts of spoiled, fermented, or legume-rich forage at once.

---

### ○ Ruminal Stasis (Impaction)
- **Cause**: Overfeeding, sudden feed changes, physical weakness (common in winter).
- **Symptoms**: Loss of appetite, no rumination, arched back, rapid breathing.
- **Treatment**: Administer rumen stimulants such as Tumix, Tafumin, or Torumin; massage left abdomen to restore rumen motility; treat bloat if concurrent.
- **Prevention**: Introduce feed changes gradually; avoid overfeeding.

---

### ○ Bronchial Catarrh / Bronchitis
- **Cause**: Sudden weather changes, inhalation of irritant gases (typically in winter).
- **Symptoms**: Coughing, nasal discharge, labored breathing.
- **Treatment**: Use antitussives (e.g., codeine phosphate, morphine hydrochloride), antipyretics (e.g., aspirin, APC), and antibiotics (e.g., penicillin, terramycin, gentamicin, lincomycin).
- **Prevention**: Maintain proper humidity, ventilation, and stable temperature in housing.

---

### ○ Pneumonia
- **Cause**: Secondary to bronchial catarrh or *Pasteurella* infection.
- **Symptoms**: High fever, coughing, difficulty breathing.
- **Treatment**: Intramuscular antibiotics such as gentamicin, lincomycin, kanamycin, tylosin.
- **Prevention**: Eliminate contributing causes (cold drafts, poor ventilation).

---

### ○ Spinal Paralysis (Parelaphostrongylus infection)
- **Cause**: Microfilariae infection transmitted via mosquitoes.
- **Season**: August–September.
- **Symptoms**: Head tilting, paralysis of hind limbs and lower back.
- **Treatment**: Intramuscular injection of Spaton for 4–5 days.
- **Prevention**: Prevent mosquito bites.

---

### ○ Lungworm (Dictyocaulus infection)
- **Cause**: Lungworm infection via snails → contaminated pasture.
- **Symptoms**: Coughing, respiratory distress, chronic bronchitis; chronic cases show malnutrition and diarrhea.
- **Treatment**: Deworm with drugs like Ripacol.
- **Prevention**: Avoid snail-infested pastures.

---

### ○ Stomach Worms (Haemonchosis)
- **Season**: Common in late autumn.
- **Symptoms**: Weight loss, anemia.
- **Treatment**: Deworm with drugs such as Rintal or Tetrasol-20.
- **Prevention**: Avoid contaminated or overgrazed pastures; use clean water sources.

---

### ○ Liver Fluke Disease (Fascioliasis)
- **Cause**: Liver fluke parasites (*Fasciola*, *Dicrocoelium*, *Paramphistomum*) in the bile ducts.
- **Infection Path**: Goat → snail → contaminated grass → goat.
- **Symptoms**: Mild fever, anorexia, poor nutrition, anemia.
- **Treatment**: Administer liver fluke treatments such as Bichinol, Nilzan orally; Bilibon intramuscularly.
- **Prevention**: Eliminate intermediate hosts (snails); avoid infested pastures.

---

### ○ Pinkeye (Infectious Conjunctivitis)
- **Cause**: *Moraxella* bacterial infection, spread by flies and insects.
- **Symptoms**: Tearing, eye discharge, redness; corneal opacity and ulcers may lead to blindness.
- **Treatment**:
  - Isolate the affected goat.
  - Rinse eyes frequently with 3% boric acid solution.
  - Apply antibiotic eye ointment or drops (e.g., Hostacycline) for 3–4 days.
  - Use pinkeye spray to disinfect.
- **Prevention**: Control flies and insect vectors; disinfect contaminated barns and equipment.

---

### ○ Cyanide Poisoning
- **Cause**: Consumption of cyanogenic plants (e.g., azalea leaves, young sorghum shoots).
- **Symptoms**: Foamy saliva, convulsions, respiratory distress, bleeding from nose and mouth before death.
- **Treatment**:
  - *Mild*: May recover naturally.
  - *Severe*: Administer 1–2 mL of 20% sodium nitrite IV and 3–5 mL of 20% sodium thiosulfate IV.
- **Prevention**: Do not allow goats to graze on plants that contain cyanide.
