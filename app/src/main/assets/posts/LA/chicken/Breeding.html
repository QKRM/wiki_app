<h1>Breeding</h1>
<ul>
<li>Selection of healthy and sound-looking chicken in the villages or markets is important, if you want to assure a healthy flock and a high productivity. You should therefore know how to judge the quality of different breeds in different ages and sex, based primarily on their looks, vocalizations and behavior.</li>
<li>In the following, we will introduce simple guidelines on how to select a sound bird at different ages, and introduce what to consider in terms of breed selection.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chicken Selection</h2>
<p>It is important to look for different features in chicks, growers, hens and cocks. Select or buy your new birds early in the day, as stress from lack of water, feed and rest, will make most birds look rather sick and drowsy.</p>
<p>A healthy, newly hatched chick should have the following features</p>
<ul>
<li>Well-developed body length and depth</li>
<li>Shiny, dry, thick and colored
down feathers</li>
<li>Soft belly</li>
<li>Clean, dry navel</li>
<li>Thick shanks with spaced and
straight toes</li>
<li>Big clear eyes</li>
<li>Lively behavior</li>
</ul>
<p>A healthy and good grower should have the following features</p>
<ul>
<li>Should appear healthy and lively</li>
<li>Feathering shiny and normal
(may depend on the breed)</li>
<li>Large size for the age</li>
<li>Eyes clear and shiny</li>
<li>Clean and dry beak and nostrils</li>
<li>Clean feathers around the vent</li>
<li>Straight legs and toes</li>
</ul>
<p>A healthy and good egg-layer should have the following
features:
* Should appear healthy and lively
* Feathering normal for the breed
* A red comb (more colored when in lay)
* Eyes clear and shiny
* Clean and dry beak and nostrils
* Clean feathers around the vent
* Straight legs and toes, with no signs of scaly legs
* Legs less colored in lay
* The breast bone should not be too sharp
* A big broad bottom

<p>In small flocks, it is relatively easy to check whether the hens are laying or not (Figure 38). Check with your hand. The distance between the pubic bones (top) will be equivalent to two fingers, when the hen is in lay. Only one finger may pass between the pubic bones, when the hen is outside lay. A healthy and good cock should have the following features</p>
<ul>
<li>alert and protective nature</li>
<li>shiny and normal feathering for the breed Amount of feed given and eaten at
different ages of local poultry</li>
<li>clear and shiny eyes</li>
<li>clean and dry beak and nostrils</li>
<li>clean feathers around the vent</li>
<li>straight legs and toes with no signs of scaly legs</li>
<li>large size relative to the hens</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be an advantage to keep records on the growth and productivity of each bird in order to select birds according to features such as egg production, growth (meat production) and broody behavior. Keeping records may help you select the best layers or the best mother to protect the chicks. See chapter 8 for examples on record keeping.</p>
<h2>Breed selection</h2>
<ul>
<li>When you have succeeded in improving your productivity and survival of your local free-range poultry through improved management, housing, feeding, chick protection etc., you may want to further increase productivity by introducing better breeds.</li>
<li>A breed is a group of poultry with a characteristic body form and feather contours. These unique characteristics are inherited from one generation to the next. Also features such as the comb, colour of ear lobes and shank colours and length are usually determined by breed. In every breed, different varieties can occur usually determined by plumage colour. Thus, a white and a black hen may just be different varieties of the same breed.</li>
<li>Figure 40 shows three different breeds commonly found in tropical regions, i.e., Frizzled Feathers, Naked-Neck and the Dwarf. Naked-Neck genes are found in almost every village, and are believed to be a natural adaptation to avoid heat stress. Frizzled feathers may look ill at a first glance, but is also common in most village-based systems. Dwarf poultry show standard colours and plumage, but tend to be 2/3 of the normal size for poultry, mostly because of the short shanks.</li>
</ul>
<p>src="images/a8ca8a70dbc283dee04f94043d8e6407.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Chickens in industrialised systems are usually kept for two distinct purposes, that is either egg or meat  roduction. A high productivity in either egg or meat production is a result of specialised breeding program. The so-called dual-purpose breeds are also a result of breeding programmes, and may produce more eggs and more meat than
traditional birds.</li>
<li>
<p>The features of birds specialised in egg production, meat production or both (dual purpose) are shown in Figure 41. Laying hens are "boat-shaped" with a long straight back and a big bottom. Meat producers (broilers) are long-legged, in a more upright position and wings in high position on the body. Dual-purpose breeds are a form in between the layers and broilers. Local breeds often have the form of a dual-purpose breed, although much less heavy in body form and size.

<em>Typical breeds producing eggs (left), meat (middle) and both (right)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important to select birds, which are suited for the kind of production you have in mind, and which are suited for the conditions under which they are kept, e.g., freerange or confinement.</p>
</li>
<li>The commercial sector has developed highly specialised hybrids (crosses of several breeds) of which layers can produce 300 eggs per year and broilers can reach 2 kg in 6 weeks. To obtain this high production, the hybrids have very specific requirements to management, feeding and disease management and production costs are high. They are therefore not normally suited in free-range and improved free-range systems.</li>
<li>Of all chickens reared in Uganda, over 80% are indigenous chicken. Unlike the commercial layers and broilers, the breeds of our local chickens are not well defined. For this reason, it is difficult to say this breed is for Lugbara, Alur, Iteso, Acholi or even just by certain genetic features. Therefore, let us consider all our local chicken to be
of the same breed since no particular feature-like uniform feather colour, comb type, shank characteristics- identifies them.</li>
<li>The local chickens as stated earlier, without improvement in basic husbandry practices remain low output breeds despite having good market value. Improving their breedsby  electing the good ones and also crossbreeding- alongside programmed hatching will help us multiply our stock easily to meet the market demand.</li>
<li>In Uganda, the National animal breeding centre has recently introduced the Kuroiler breed, an Indian indigenous dual-purpose chicken. Kuroilers are heavy and fastgrowing chicken without broody behaviour. They can survive on free-range like our local chicken also. They can, therefore, be used for crossbreeding with our indigenous chicken. Fortunately, many of them have been introduced in the entire West Nile region and some parts of the north.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Cross-breeding</h1>
<ul>
<li>Cross-breeding is mating two different breeds to produce offsprings that produce the eggs or the meat the farmer wants. Cross-breeding improves growth and production. For example, mating kuroilers and local birds results in offsprings that grow faster and lay more eggs. But the offsprings also often lose the habit of incubating eggs. Additionally, the offsprings are often more resistant to local disease conditions than the parent kuroiler.</li>
<li>To increase production from local chickens, crossbreeding with other breeds can be practiced. It is however, important to consult a veterinarian, who may recommend suitable and available breeds to increase egg production, growth or both. It is also important to be aware that the offspring will obtain different qualities from the parents that are pure breeds.</li>
<li>It is also important to stress that if a cross-breed is introduced at village level, it is crucial that management, feeding and health protection schemes are improved.</li>
