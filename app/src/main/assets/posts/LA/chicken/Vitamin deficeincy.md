|Vitamin deficeincy diseases|Vitamins are nutrients required by animals in small amounts. Vitamin deficiencies are common in young birds and so their feeds during brooding should be supplemented.|
|Cause|• Lack of nutrients in the feeding|
|Signs and symptoms|• Retarded growth, rickets and leg weakness, swollen joints (hock joints, joints of ribs plus others)<br>• Nervous signs (e.g., inclination in movement, paralysis)<br>• Discharge from nose and eye, white stuff covering eyeball<br>• Pustules in mouth<br>• Decreased egg production, poor hatchability<br>• Curled toes and other nonspecific signs|
|Prevention/treatment|• Supply vitamin powder in water or buy vitamin/mineral powders (premix) in feed and provide greens to birds.<br>• Note: In scavenging local chicken, vitamins are obtained from vegetables that they eat, in commercial intensive chicken deficiency may result from<br>insufficient levels of vitamins in the diet or when feeds have overstayed or gone bad.|
