# Management of Postpartum Cows

## ▣ Immediate Care After Calving

As soon as a pregnant cow gives birth, the **first priority** is to determine whether the cow can **nurse the calf**.

- If the cow is a **first-calf heifer** with underdeveloped udders or refuses to nurse:
  - Forced weaning and **artificial feeding** must be implemented.
  - On the **day of birth**, it is essential to **thaw and feed colostrum** previously secured from nearby dairy farms.
  - Afterward, continue with artificial feeding.

- If the cow **refuses to nurse**, attempt **manual assistance** for 1–3 days to help the calf suckle. If the cow still refuses:
  - Proceed with **forced weaning** and artificial feeding.

## ▣ Nutritional Management

During lactation, the cow’s **nutritional needs remain similar to pre-calving levels**, to:
- Support **uterine recovery**
- Satisfy **increased nutrient demands for milk production**

---

## ▣ General Postpartum Care

1. **Maintain proper nutrition levels**  
2. **Encourage exercise and sunlight exposure** to:
   - Promote **Vitamin D synthesis**
   - Improve **blood circulation**
   - Aid in **uterine recovery**
   - **Shorten the interval to estrus return**

## ▣ Weaning and Estrus Return

Lactation may **delay the return of estrus** in breeding cows.  
Thus, **early weaning** of the calf is recommended when feasible.

- If the calf is already consuming about **500g of milk replacer**, weaning can be done at any time.

### Effects of Weaning Age on Estrus Return:

| Calf Weaning Age | Days to Estrus Return |
|------------------|------------------------|
| 40 days old      | ~22.8 days             |
| 60 days old      | ~26.8 days             |

Early weaning supports faster return to estrus, improving reproductive efficiency.
