# Feed

## ▣ Feeding Principles

The key point in raising replacement heifers is to **provide high-quality roughage ad libitum** (free-choice feeding). Additionally, it is important to maintain a **daily weight gain of 500–600g before the onset of puberty**, enabling heifers to reach sexual maturity around 12–15 months of age.

When purchasing replacement heifers externally, it is advisable to prioritize **healthy and well-conditioned animals** with smooth body outlines over low prices.

The feeding standard for heifers should be:
- **Provide as much high-quality roughage as possible.**
- Use **concentrates only to supplement nutrient deficiencies.**

Providing sufficient quality roughage is a critical focus not only for breeding heifers but also for those raised for fattening. High-quality roughage:
- **Maximizes the development of the rumen**, especially the **first (rumen)** and **second stomach (reticulum)**.
- Promotes healthy development of the **post-ruminal digestive tract**.

### Risks of Inadequate Roughage:
- Can lead to digestive issues or liver disorders.
- May shorten the animal's productive reproductive lifespan.

It is also important to ensure that the animal receives enough **trace minerals and vitamins** during this stage. While commercial supplements are common, these nutrients can also be sufficiently provided through:
- **Ample quality forage** (such as fresh grass or silage),
- **A small amount of concentrate feed**.

## ▣ Growth Targets

The target **daily weight gain differs before and after sexual maturity**:
- **Before sexual maturity**: Aim for ~**600g/day**.
- **After sexual maturity until calving**: Aim for ~**400g/day**.

## ▣ Types of Roughage Available on Farms

Farmers can use various types of forage during the rearing phase, such as:
- Wild grasses
- Rice straw
- Fresh forage crops (green feed)
- Silage (ensiled forage)

## ▣ Nutritional Impact on Growth and Reproduction

Feed intake level and nutritional quality are **closely linked to body development and future reproductive performance** in heifers. Proper feeding management during the rearing phase leads to:

- Healthy growth and development
- Earlier onset of sexual maturity
- Improved conception rates
- Higher overall reproductive efficiency

If nutritional intake falls **below 20% of standard nutritional requirements**, the onset of sexual maturity may be **delayed by 2–3 months**, increasing the number of non-productive (open) days and resulting in **significant economic loss**.
