# Disease Prevention in Breeding Cows

---

## ▣ 1. Reproductive Disorder Prevention

### ● Key Preventive Measures:
- Proper **feeding and nutritional management**
- **Sufficient exercise** to prevent both malnutrition and obesity
- **Hygienic management** before and after calving:
  - Prevent contamination through the vulva
  - Manage retained placenta promptly
  - Monitor and treat discharge for 2–3 weeks postpartum

The ultimate reproductive goal should be **one calf per cow per year**.

### ● Common Reproductive Disorders:

#### 1. Ovarian Dysfunction
- Includes underdevelopment, regression, or atrophy of the ovaries
- Caused by poor follicular development
- Prevention: Provide high-quality forage, protein, phosphorus, and vitamin A
- Treatment: Intramuscular injection of **PMSG or HCG** (500–1,000μg)

#### 2. Ovulation Disorder
- Includes **persistent estrus** and **ovarian cysts**
- Caused by imbalance of **LH** and **FSH**
- Treatment: Intramuscular injection of **HCG**
  - Oil-based: 5,000–10,000 IU
  - Water-based: 10,000 IU

#### 3. Repeat Breeding Cow
- Normal reproductive organs and cycle, but fails to conceive after 3+ attempts
- No specific treatment; requires a combination of proper nutrition and hygiene

#### 4. Endometritis
- Caused by **Vibrio**, **Brucella**, **Trichomonas**, or **E. coli**
- Results in pus in the uterus
- Treatment: Uterine irrigation and intrauterine antibiotic infusion

## ▣ 2. Udder Health Management

Maintaining udder health is essential for productivity, cow welfare, and farm profitability. Poor udder health leads to:
- **Reduced milk yield**
- **Deteriorated milk quality**
- **Fever, appetite loss, and even death**

### ● Types and Symptoms of Mastitis:

#### 1. Clinical Mastitis
- Swollen, hot, and painful udder
- Visible changes in milk (clots, pus)
- Severe cases may require culling

#### 2. Subclinical Mastitis
- No visible symptoms
- Detected only through lab tests (CMT, bacterial culture)
- If untreated, often develops into clinical mastitis and causes economic losses

---

### ● Risk Factors for Abnormal Udder:

1. **Anatomical defects**:
   - Weak teat sphincter, abnormal teat shape or canal
2. **Unhygienic housing**:
   - Dirty barn, lack of disinfection, poor bedding
3. **Nutritional imbalance**:
   - Mineral/vitamin deficiency, abrupt feed changes, moldy feed
4. **Hormonal/metabolic issues**:
   - Estrogen excess or progesterone deficiency
5. **Unsanitary pre-/post-calving care**:
   - No antibiotic dry treatment, no teat dip
6. **Milking machine problems**:
   - High vacuum pressure, worn liners, rapid milking rate (>65 strokes/min)
7. **Poor milking hygiene**:
   - Shared towels, no teat sanitization, contaminated equipment
8. **Genetic predisposition**:
   - Breeding cows with heritable susceptibility to mastitis

## ▣ 3. Mastitis Prevention Measures

### ● Proper Milking Techniques and Machine Inspection

- Regularly check:
  - Vacuum pressure (optimal: ~50 kPa)
  - Milking speed
  - Liner replacement
  - Vacuum pump capacity

#### Key Practices:
1. **Clean only the teats** (not the whole udder)
2. **Pre-milking stripping**:
   - Stimulates oxytocin release
   - Helps detect early clinical mastitis
   - Prevents antibiotic-contaminated milk from mixing

   ⚠️ Use a **strip cup** (not the floor) to avoid environmental contamination

3. **Avoid over-milking**:
   - Milking should not exceed **5 minutes**
   - Use max 3 milking units per person
   - Avoid machine stripping after natural flow ends

4. **Milk infected cows last** and isolate them to reduce disease spread

---

### ● Teat Dipping & Spray Disinfection

- After milking, teat canals remain open for 15–30 minutes, risking bacterial entry
- Disinfection is essential using:
  - **Teat dips**: Replace solution frequently to maintain efficacy
  - **Sprays**: Ensure complete coverage of the teat surface

---

### ● Dry Period Management

Dry cow therapy is crucial for udder health:
- Apply long-acting **dry cow ointments or intramammary antibiotics**
- Prevent mastitis during the dry period and early lactation

#### Key Actions:
- Collect milk samples by quarter for lab testing
- Choose antibiotics based on cultured pathogens
- Address environmental sources of **E. coli** or **Strep spp.** to avoid relapse

If a cow repeatedly shows high somatic cell counts (SCC), consider:
- **Culling genetically susceptible cows**
- **Improving sanitation and nutrition**

---

### ● Additional Preventive Tips:

- Maintain **clean indoor and outdoor environments**
- Provide **balanced rations** and avoid moldy feed
- Trim tail and udder hair, maintain hoof health
- Use gloves, disposable towels, and disinfectants during milking
- Keep cows standing for **30 minutes post-milking** to allow teat closure

> ✅ *Pre-milking stimulation and hygiene are essential for milk letdown and udder infection control.*
