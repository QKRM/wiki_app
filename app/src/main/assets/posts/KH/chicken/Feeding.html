        <h2>Nutritional value of the feed</h2>
<p>Advice on feeds and feeding will be different for free-range, improved free-range systems or smallscale confined systems of poultry production, basically due to different economic situations.</p>
<p>In the following, we will focus only on improved free-range systems and discuss the importance of feed requirements, feed types, feed mixing, and feed costs.</p>
<h3>Why give supplementary feed?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chicken, like any living animals, eat to be alive, to grow and then produce (eggs/meat) or reproduce (mate and get offspring).</li>
<li>Supplementary feeding is essential if you want to increase the production of meat and eggs from local poultry and improved breeds.</li>
<li>Even small flocks will eventually starve during certain periods of the year, if they are fed only leftovers and the feed they find by scavenging.</li>
<li>Lack of feed or water will reduce the birds’ resistance to diseases and parasites, and subsequently increase flock mortality.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What to feed?</h2>
<ul>
<li>In general, poultry, like other animals, need feed containing energy and protein, as well as vitamins and minerals.</li>
<li>The need for feed will change, depending on the age and status (chicks, grower, egg layer, broody hen) of the bird.</li>
<li>The cheapest way to supplement the diet of your poultry, is to use local resources.</li>
<li>However, many vitamins and nutrients are destroyed if stored too long or under suboptimal conditions, e.g., high humidity and heat.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of feeds</h2>
<p>The nutrients that must be present in feeds are
* water
* carbohydrates
* fats and oils
* protein
* vitamins
* minerals</p>
<p>When all these nutrients are provided in the feeds, then it’s a balanced diet.depending on the type of feed, it will contain more or less energy and protein, as well as vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>src="images/007fe75ccfb70a167e487b4b718f9fca.png" title="Optional title" /></p>
<p><em>Feed types divided into sources of nutrients: a = energy, b = protein, c = minerals, d = vitamins. Water should always be available</em></p>
<h2>Energy feeds</h2>
<ul>
<li>Energy feeds are the most important feeds to maintain the body functions and keep the chicken active. Normally, at least ¾ of a poultry diet is made of energy feeds.</li>
<li>The energy in feed is mainly supplied as carbohydrates (“sugars”) but sometime fats and oils as well.</li>
<li>Cereals (grains), root tubers are the most important energy feeds.</li>
<li>The cereals and their waste products found in the north and west Nile regions of</li>
</ul>
<p>Uganda include maize, maize bran, rice, rice bran, millet, malwa waste, wheat waste, sorghum and kitchen/brewer’s refuse from any of these.</p>
<ul>
<li>The root tubers include cassava, sweet potatoes, yams, plantain and banana meal.</li>
<li>Roots and tubers should be soaked in water for 60 minutes or cooked before drying to remove harmful substances. The proportion in the diet should be kept below 1/10.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Protein</h2>
<ul>
<li>Proteins are body building foods. They are needed for growth and keeping up a good health status.</li>
<li>Normally the diet should have about 1/5 of total mixed feed made of protein-rich feeds, as they are very expensive.</li>
<li>Growth of birds like in other animals is rapid when they are young, and therefore good quality proteins should be supplied for chicks to grow fast.</li>
<li>A high level of protein is needed by egg-laying birds since birds release a lot of protein in eggs.</li>
<li>Protein may come from either animal sources or plants.</li>
<li>Plant sources of proteins include leguminous seeds such as cowpeas, beans, and oil cakes from e.g., ground nuts, cotton seeds, palm kernels, and coconuts.</li>
<li>Harmful substances are present in some protein-rich plants, e.g., beans.</li>
<li>All plant-based protein sources must first be roasted or cooked like for humans before grinding and mixing. Heating removes bad substances that prevent digestion of those legumes.</li>
<li>Examples of protein-rich local feeds from animal source are: maggots, termites, insects, earth worms, meat scraps, fish scraps (such as Mukene/Nkenje, fish processing wastes), fish meal, meat meal, bone meal, blood meal, feather meal. Fish and their waste products like offals are the easiest to get for chicken in areas around fishing communities.</li>
<li>Insects have emerged as a good source of proteins with the potential of raising reasonable quantities for chicken in the backyard. In the rain season, chickens in the scavenging system have access to the insects as they roam around. At night, providing light in chicken houses can attract insects like white ants and flies into the chicken house. The light is best hanged above a tray of water to trap the insects. Other sources of insects that can be raised include termites and fly larvae (maggots).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Minerals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Minerals are important for bone formation, eggshell formation and a good health status.</li>
<li>The most important minerals are calcium and phosphorous. To produce strong shells for their eggs, laying hens need free access to calcium (limestone or crushed shells). Adult birds are usually able to balance their intake according to their needs.</li>
<li>Examples of sources for minerals are: bone meal, crushed oyster shells, snail shells, common salt, premixes, lime and burned eggshells.</li>
<li>Using bone meal or eggshells is a good way of balancing the calcium and phosphorus levels. Eggshells should always be scorched or cooked before re-use in diets to remove any disease germs</li>
</ul>

src="images/7790e6e68bd465d5f2cb3a5ff1a86409.jpg" title="Optional title" /></p>
<h2>Vitamins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Vitamins are nutrients required by animals in small amounts.</li>
<li>Vitamins A, B2, and D3 are considered very important because many problems arise when birds lack these vitamins.</li>
<li>Sunlight and green grass or green fodder normally provide Vitamin A and D, whereas Vitamin B may come from fresh cow dung.</li>
<li>Vitamin B may also be added by giving e.g., Riboflavin tablets. Additional vitamins may be given in very small quantities and purchased through drug stores or feed sellers, but this is normally not needed for scavenging poultry.</li>
<li>Confined birds always need additional vitamins mixed into their feeds. In high laying birds, supplementation with factory-made vitamins is necessary. Vitamin deficiencies are common in young birds and so their feeds during brooding should be supplemented.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Water</h2>
<ul>
<li>About 60% of the bird’s body and 65% of the egg is made of water.</li>
<li>Clean water must be provided to poultry at all times!!!</li>
<li>Often, chickens in villages are not provided water specifically for them. They drink from small ponds or dirty water after washing utensils or clothes. This may lead to the spread of diseases such as Newcastle disease or parasites.</li>
<li>Water intake increases with an increase in environmental temperature. A high level of salt in the diet also increases water intake.</li>
<li>Lack of water can seriously retard growth and reduce egg production, especially in hot areas, like some northern parts of Uganda. Lack of water can cause death of chicken in a day or two in confined birds.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Establishing a seasonal feed calendar</h2>
<ul>
<li>Feeds are scarce in some seasons of the year. Chickens compete with humans for food.</li>
<li>It is important to plan for seasons of scarcity and store feeds when they are abundant.</li>
<li>We should plan to reduce numbers of chicken in the seasons of scarcity too. For example, we should avoid raising young chickens during seasons with very limited feed supplies.</li>
<li>This is possible through programmed hatching or just selling or eating the eggs if hatching is likely to be in season of scarcity.</li>
<li>Maybe during some months, it is only viable to keep a few hens and a cock on maintenance level in order to start a production of chickens when feed supply increases.</li>
<li>On the other hand, it may be profitable to grow some feed for chickens if they can be raised at times of the year when market prices are high.</li>
<li>The seasonal calendar should be drawn in participatory way, together with the facilitator 
and trainees

<em>Seasonal calendar (matrix) showing the types of nutrients available in each season</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Nutritional requirements and feed mixing at Home</h2>
<h3>Feeding Methods</h3>
<ul>
<li>The predominant method of feeding indigenous chicken in Uganda is scavenging in the free-range system. It is a very low-cost method in terms of feed costs and labour requirements.</li>
<li>The free-range system is advantageous in that poultry find the majority of their feeds by scavenging the surroundings. In the process, the pick greens, insects, earthworms, nuts, grains, and grits necessary for crushing feeds in the gizzard.</li>
<li>The best time for scavenging is early morning and late afternoon, as there are most insects and less heat.</li>
<li>Scavenging, however, has its disadvantages such as exposing birds to diseases and predators, birds spending energy for growth and production on hunting, worse when feeds are scarce as in dry season.</li>
<li>Therefore, scavenging does not meet the daily requirements of productive birds and so the need for supplementation with mixed feeds.</li>
<li>
<p>The best time for giving supplementary feed will be in the morning and in the evening, when the birds come back to the house.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mixed feed is presented to chicken in feed troughs near water containers.</p>
</li>
<li>Ad libitum water should be provided in shady areas during the day to avoid
heat stress.</li>
<li>Small</li>
</ul>
<h2>How much to feed?</h2>
<ul>
<li>If the birds are scavenging, we supplement their diet with about 30-40 g of feed/bird/day from week 4-6 and onwards.</li>
<li>If adult birds are not scavenging, give them a feed supplement of at least 70g (seven tablespoonful) per bird per day</li>
</ul>

<p>Explanation of the table: Chicks should be fed throughout the day at a rate of 12g per chick per day in week one, then 20g in week two, increasing by at least 5g per week until 50g per bird per day. This is for chicks in artificial brooding, the recommended method in programmed hatching. The chicks are released out at 2 months of age and then supplemented like adult birds.</p>
<ul>
<li>To assure a stable egg and meat production, it is better to give a little feed on a continuous basis, than to give large quantities during harvest seasons or festivals and no feed during lean seasons.</li>
<li>If feeds are too costly, you should consider reducing your flock size, rather than reducing the amount of feed given to each bird.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Feed mixing (concentrate) for adult birds</h2>
<ul>
<li>In free-ranging birds, concentrate feeds are used for feeding the chicks and supplementing adult hens that scavenge for food.</li>
<li>Formulating and mixing of poultry feeds may be based on simple assumptions about the nutritional requirements of the birds and the content of the feedstuffs.</li>
<li>Locally available ingredients should be dried in the shade (the sun may destroy important vitamins) and grounded in a mortar before mixing.</li>
<li>A good feed must have energy feeds, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. All these must be balanced.</li>
<li>Energy and protein sources form the bulk of feed and so they are called base feeds in feed mixing. Minerals and vitamins are added in small amounts.</li>
<li>As a common rule, for adult birds the ratio of energy to protein a diet should be 2:1, meaning, if you mix a feed of 3 kg, two kg will be energy sources(like maize, maize bran, cassava flour, etc) and one kg will be protein source like fish. Other supplements (vitamins and minerals) are then added to make the food complete (balanced diet). Box 1 gives an example on how to make a 10 kg feed mixing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example of calculation of a feed mixing</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>If we are to make a 10kg simple diet for supplementation in the ratio 2:1:0.5 for Energy: Protein: Vitamins and minerals, we can proceed as follows:

Energy = 2/3.5 x10=5.7kg=6kg

Proteins = 1/3.5 x10=2.9kg=3kg

Minerals =0.5/3.5 x10=1.4kg=1kg

Therefore, all your energy sources like maize, maize bran, millet should equal to 6kg. Also, protein sources like fish, soybean, beans, and others should equal to 3kg. Likewise, minerals and vitamin premixes should add up to 1 kg. We can, therefore, have a simple diet as in Table below.

<ul>
<li>Once the formula is generated as in the example in box 1 above, you then mix the feed by first mixing the small items before including them gradually into the bulk feed. This will ensure a uniform mix of the ingredients.</li>
<li>Locally available containers such as tomato tins or matchboxes may be used for easy measurement of the different ingredients (Figure 33). Grams or percentages should be transferred into local quantities for field practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>src="images/2c20e8f47c49b5b7724ecc0208467df6.png" />
<em>Different containers (plastic bottles, tin cans or calabashes) contain different amounts</em></p>
<ul>
<li>We first mix premix and salt to get 0.5kg. Then we add that to shells to get 1 kg. Then add the 1kg formed to either 1kg of fish or millet flour. We continue the process until we mix all the ingredients into one feed of uniform color.</li>
<li>You mix by a spade on a clean floor while small ingredients are mixed separately in another container like a basin. This gradual mixing of feed items is what is called progressive mixing and is recommended. The one in which you first pour bulk feeds on the floor before adding small ones will result in nutrient imbalance.</li>
<li>The young chickens will need relatively more protein in their diet than adult birds, so the best solution is to mix two different kinds of rations for young and adult birds, respectively. Table 9 gives an example of a simple ration for supplementing chicks.</li>
<li>If you do not want to mix two different rations, you can alternatively give a little extra supplement of a good protein source to the young chickens, e.g. maggots and termites during the first 6 weeks</li>
<li>Alternatively, a chick starter ration can be used during the first 4-6 weeks of age. In this way you will ensure that the chicks are provided with everything they need during these most vulnerable weeks.</li>
<li>If a mixed feed is not available temporarily, at least supplement with kitchen refuse, trapped or raised insects/earthworms, green vegetables, milling residues, offals from fish processing, blood meal.</li>
<li>Dried and ground vegetables or even ruminal contents are also good alternatives for dry matter in periods of scarcity. Green vegetables bring out the deep yellow colour of the egg yolk, which some customers prefer.</li>
<li>Birds fed on greens should be dozed against worms monthly. Before greens are fed to birds, they should be washed in a solution containing salt (to kill parasite eggs / larval stages) and rinsed with fresh water.</li>
<li>Do not give too much common salt to chicken as it damages their kidneys.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Feed Storage</h2>
<ul>
<li>In general, you should not store mixed feed more than a few weeks to avoid contamination from mould, bacteria or get damaged byrodents. It is recommended that feed should
be as fresh as possible and if possible, not stay for more than one month (maximum 3months).</li>
<li>Feeds should be pilled on racks or raised structures from the floor to avoid dampness.</li>
<li>The store should be leak-proof and free from vermin like rodents which cause feed wastage and disease spread.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Twelve simple rules for feed management</h2>
<ul>
<li>Before buying, mixing, and storing feeds, it is important to stick some underlying principles of good feed management. It is crucial to:<ol>
<li>Use local feed ingredients for local birds;</li>
<li>Know the quality or feed value, and changing prices of each feed ingredient;</li>
<li>Buy missing feed ingredients, such as vitamins or protein sources locally;</li>
<li>Change the feed formulation depending on availability, quality or feed value, and changing prices;</li>
<li>Reduce the flock size in free-range systems during lean seasons and if the feed becomes too costly;</li>
<li>If you change feed and feeding level, always do it slow and gradual;</li>
<li>Mix feed ingredients uniformly in relatively small quantities to avoid too long storage time;</li>
<li>Use locally available materials such as tomato tins or matchboxes for quantifying the different ingredients to be mixed. Grams or percentages do not work in practice;</li>
<li>Store mixed feed or feed ingredients separately upon a platform approx. 30 cm above the floor;</li>
<li>Stop the entry of rats, pigeons, or other type of birds into the feed store room;</li>
<li>Make sufficient ventilation of air so that the feed ingredients are not wet due to humidity;</li>
<li>Be careful that feed ingredients, which are moldy, discolored or from which pests have eaten, are not used.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Simple techniques for feed production in the field</h2>
<ul>
<li>Maggots and termites are excellent and cheap sources of protein for chicken. However, they will only be a supplement to other feeds.</li>
<li>Give the maggots or termites to the small chicks, as they have the biggest need for a good protein source.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Simple techniques for growing maggots</h2>
<p>Maggots may be grown by a simple technique and used to supplement the diet of the young chicks</p>
<ul>
<li>Blood, offal, and cow manure are mixed in a large open pot.</li>
<li>The pot is filled with 1/3 water. Flies will lay their eggs in the mixture, and the maggots will feed on it.</li>
<li>Leave the pot open during daytime and closed during the night.</li>
<li>After 5-10 days (depending on temperature), when the maggots are ready to pupate,
you collect the maggots by gently pouring water into the pot. The maggots will float and you can then wash them, and feed them directly to the birds.</li>
<li>Remember to place the pot away from public places, as the smell at times may be offensive.

</ul>
<h2>Simple techniques for growing termites</h2>
<p>Figure 35 shows a simple method for growing termites to be applied in dry seasons.
* Take a pot with a short neck and a capacity of at least 10 liters.
* Fill it up with cow dung and straw, and sprinkle it all with a little water.
* Set the pot upside down with the opening on dry soil.
* After one day and one night, the pot will have termites. You empty the contents in front of the hen house in the morning.

<h2>Poultry vices</h2>
<p>Abnormal behaviors can develop in poultry flocks at any stage, whether in the brooder or adult stage. Factors that may result in vices in chicken include overcrowding, insufficient feeds, deficiency of some nutrients like protein, phosphorus and salt, imbalanced light distribution in house or just learned behavior from exposed cloaca during egg laying. Having open nests, rough handling eggs that cause them to break can promote cannibalism and egg eating. The types of vices in chicken include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cannibalism (pecking one another),</li>
<li>Egg eating</li>
<li>Toe and vent pecking</li>
<li>Feather pecking</li>
</ul>
<p>These vices may cause death of birds. For example, massive cannibalism may cause removal of intestines of fellow hen and so its death.</p>
