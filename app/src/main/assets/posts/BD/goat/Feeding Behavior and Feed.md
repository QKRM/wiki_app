# 2. Feeding Behavior and Feed

## □ Grazing Behavior

Goats exhibit significantly different grazing behavior compared to cattle and sheep. They are selective eaters and tend to prefer only the tender parts of plants, even within the same species. Goats also prefer fresh, clean, and new forage.

Unlike cattle, which graze cleanly in one area when pastured, goats wander continuously, selectively nibbling preferred plants sparsely. Once they are somewhat full, they often stop grazing and continue wandering instead. This behavior suggests that grazing time should be managed strategically.

Rather than allowing goats to graze freely all day, it is more effective to allow controlled grazing for about 2–3 hours and manage them in housing for the rest of the time.

Goats also enjoy browsing on leaves and twigs (browse) and may even strip bark from trees. Many of the plants goats prefer—especially woody plants—contain phenolic compounds and tannins not typically found in grasses. These substances help prevent diarrhea and parasitic diseases, which are common issues in goat farming.

This grazing behavior appears to be an instinctive trait for survival in the wild, suggesting that goats still retain many wild characteristics compared to other domesticated animals.

## □ Appropriate Feed Management

Fiber digestion in the rumen occurs most efficiently at a pH of 6 or higher. However, excessive feeding of high-energy concentrates can lower the rumen pH below 6, which harms fiber-digesting microbes and impairs digestion.

A sudden increase in concentrate feeding can drastically lower rumen pH, disrupting the optimal environment for rumen microbes and causing stress. This can lead to metabolic disorders such as indigestion, acidosis, and bloat.

Total mixed rations (TMR) are recommended because they help maintain a stable rumen pH, promote microbial activity, increase digestibility and feed intake, improve nutrient absorption, enhance productivity, and extend the animal’s productive lifespan.

During the growth phase, feeding a mix of concentrates and fibrous by-products is preferred over feeding concentrates alone. Concentrates should be given twice a day, ideally in the morning and evening.

If the feed bunk is empty, roughage such as rice straw should be offered before concentrates to stabilize rumen pH. During the fattening stage, ad libitum (free-choice) feeding is common, though in some cases, the daily feed amount is divided into three meals.

## □ Saliva Secretion and Feed Type Selection

Feed type affects both intake speed and saliva production. Pelleted feed is consumed quickly but results in less saliva. Hay, while consumed more slowly than fresh forage or silage, stimulates more rumination and saliva production.

Hay is recommended primarily for this reason. Saliva contains **mucin**, which neutralizes rumen acidity and helps prevent bloat.

A concentrate-heavy diet reduces physical stimulation of the rumen wall, which decreases rumination and saliva production, thereby weakening the rumen’s buffering capacity.

Molasses is digested the fastest, followed by beet pulp and grains, which also have high digestibility. Beet pulp is palatable and rapidly digestible, but when overfed, can cause abnormal fermentation in the rumen. It should be introduced gradually in small amounts.

Straw has low digestibility and leaves more undigested material, which may reduce total intake. In summer, to reduce metabolic heat production in the rumen, it is recommended to chop straw into 5 cm lengths before feeding.

## □ Feed Management by Growth Stage

Goats are typically raised for either reproduction or meat production. For meat producers, the primary goal is to increase body weight, improve feed efficiency, and produce high-quality meat.

Increasing the production of **propionic acid** (a type of volatile fatty acid) is desirable for weight gain. The amount and quality of concentrate feed are directly related to the production of propionic acid.

However, the efficient absorption of propionic acid requires a well-developed rumen, which depends on adequate roughage intake during the growth stage. Therefore, the common belief that free-choice concentrate feeding throughout the entire rearing period increases weight gain is incorrect.

During the growth stage, **balanced feeding**—providing moderate amounts of concentrate and sufficient roughage—is essential. Once in the fattening stage, the amount of roughage (e.g., straw) should be reduced, and concentrates can be given ad libitum.

Overfeeding concentrates without proper management leads to increased feed costs, a higher risk of metabolic diseases such as indigestion and bloat, and reduced productivity—all of which contribute to economic losses.

## □ Minerals

Minerals refer to all essential elements other than carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N). The **major essential minerals** are:

- Calcium (Ca)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Magnesium (Mg)
- Potassium (K)
- Sodium (Na)
- Chlorine (Cl)
- Iodine (I)

The **essential trace minerals** include:

- Iron (Fe)
- Zinc (Zn)
- Copper (Cu)
- Manganese (Mn)
- Cobalt (Co)
- Molybdenum (Mo)
- Selenium (Se)
- Iodine (I)

Although required in small amounts, trace minerals are crucial and are usually measured in **parts per million (ppm)** relative to the dry matter content of the feed.
