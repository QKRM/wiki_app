# Goat Milk Management

## □ Colostrum Must Be Fed

Goats generally practice natural nursing, so issues related to not feeding colostrum are rare. However, it is **essential** that newborn kids receive colostrum **for at least the first week** after birth.

**Colostrum** is the first milk secreted immediately after birth. It is rich in nutrients, containing **10 to 100 times more vitamin A** than regular milk, and is packed with **immune antibodies**. It also helps stimulate the expulsion of **meconium (first feces)**.

Newborn kids are **not born with maternal antibodies**, so they must absorb these antibodies **through colostrum** to develop immunity against various diseases.

However, since antibody concentration **decreases quickly** after birth, it is best to feed colostrum **within the first hour**.

If the mother goat dies during delivery or cannot feed colostrum for other reasons, colostrum from **another recently kidding goat** can be used. If that is not available, a **colostrum substitute** can be made by mixing:
- 500 mL of milk  
- Half a tablespoon of castor oil  
- 1 egg white  
Feed **20–30 mL per dose, 3 times a day for 3–4 days** as a substitute.

## □ Milking Goats

Goats begin producing milk immediately after giving birth. However, during the **first 1–2 weeks**, you should **not milk the goat**, as the **colostrum is needed for the kid**.

After 2 weeks, goats can be milked **twice a day (morning and evening)** for **approximately 9–10 months**. It is recommended that all goats complete their lactation period **at least 2 months before the next mating**.

Goats can be milked **by hand or using a milking machine** (costing around **$200–$700**). In both cases, **hygiene is critical**:

- Sterilize the milk container with **boiled water**.
- Secure the goat on a **milking stand**, holding its **head and hind legs** in place. Once the goat becomes accustomed, restraint may no longer be necessary.

### ○ Hand Milking

Inexperienced farmers may stress the goat to speed up milking, but it is better to keep the goat calm by offering **tasty feed**.

1. Wash the **udder and teats** with **warm water** to clean and relax the area.
2. Dry the teats with a **clean, dry towel**.
3. Begin milking using **proper hand technique**:
   - Avoid pulling the teats downward, as this can cause injury.
   - Use your **thumb and forefinger** to trap and squeeze the teat, gently pressing downward to extract milk.
4. Initially, it may take **10–15 minutes per goat**, but with practice, **5 minutes per goat** is typical.

After milking:
- Clean the teats again using **water and soap** or a **special sanitizing solution**.
- It is common to dip the teats in an **antibacterial solution**, but **boiled water** is also effective for sanitization.

### ○ Machine Milking

When using a **milking machine**, it is essential to **thoroughly clean all parts of the equipment** with appropriate cleaning agents **before and after milking**.

Most portable milking machines consist of:
- A **milking claw**
- A **pump**
- A **milk bucket or container**

Even when using a machine, it is important to **start and finish milking by hand** for several reasons:
- To **check the condition of the milk**, especially for **traces of blood**.
- To ensure proper stimulation and complete emptying of the udder.

When the machine is powered on, milk is drawn through the **claw under vacuum pressure**, then flows through the **tubing** and finally into the **collection bucket**.

After milking:
- Remove the unit carefully.
- **Clean the teats** with a **disinfectant solution**, just as you would during hand milking.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
Goats often become **dehydrated** after milking. Therefore, it is important to provide **fresh water and hay** immediately after milking.

Typically, milk should be **stored in a refrigerator** right after milking. Alternatively, it can be **pasteurized at a low temperature and then cooled** for safe storage and use.
