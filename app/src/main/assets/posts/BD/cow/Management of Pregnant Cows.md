# Management of Pregnant Cows

## ▣ General Management

For the first **six months of pregnancy**, no special management is necessary. Pregnant cows can be fed and cared for in the same way as open (non-pregnant) breeding cows or growing heifers. However, to **prevent early miscarriage**, it is advisable to **avoid any strong physical shocks** during the first 3–4 months.

## ▣ Critical Period: 2–3 Months Before Calving

The most important management phase is **2 to 3 months before calving**, when the **fetus undergoes rapid growth**, accounting for **about 70% of total fetal development**. 

During this stage:
- The cow's ability to **redistribute nutrients** to support the fetus becomes insufficient.
- It is necessary to **increase the feed amount by 20–30%** (in terms of **Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN)** and **Crude Protein (CP)**).
- This ensures the birth of a healthy calf with a higher birth weight, ultimately increasing the calf's survival rate.

### Example:
- If a cow was being fed 2–3 kg of concentrate per day, increase the amount by about **1 kg** during this period.

## ▣ Steaming-Up Feeding Method

For **first-calf heifers**, it is beneficial to gradually **increase concentrate feed until just before calving** to promote mammary gland development and increase milk yield after calving.  
This method is known as the **“steaming-up”** feeding strategy.

## ▣ Supplementation Before Calving

- **2 weeks before calving**, feed should be rich in **β-carotene** to help with:
  - Faster uterine recovery
  - Earlier return to estrus
  - Shortened calving interval

  **β-carotene sources** include:
  - Leafy green plants
  - Hay
  - Yellow corn

- **Fat-soluble vitamins and selenium injections** should also be administered 2 weeks before calving to help prevent:
  - **White muscle disease** in calves
  - **Retained placenta**
  - Stillbirths or abortions in the dam

  Products containing **Vitamin E and selenium** such as those manufactured by **Schering (USA)** using **sodium selenite** can be used.

## ▣ Vaccination Schedule

- Conduct **vaccinations twice**:
  - Once **4 weeks** before calving
  - Again **2 weeks** before calving

This helps protect the newborn calf from viral infections after birth by ensuring sufficient maternal antibodies.
