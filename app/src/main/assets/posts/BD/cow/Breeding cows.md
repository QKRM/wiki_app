# Breeding Cows

## ▣ Sexual Maturity

The onset of sexual maturity in Hanwoo heifers begins during the pubertal period, which occurs as the heifers enter their growing phase. This typically occurs at around 6 to 7 months of age and a body weight of approximately 100 to 120 kg. At this stage, the first estrus (heat) appears, ovarian follicles begin to develop, and ovulation starts.

However, the pubertal period does not indicate readiness for breeding. The period following puberty, known as the sexual maturity phase, typically occurs between 8 to 15 months of age and a weight of 180 to 250 kg. This is when the heifer becomes biologically capable of reproduction. Still, it does not necessarily mean that this is the ideal breeding age.

In general, the optimal breeding age is when the heifer is between 14 to 16 months old and weighs over 250 kg. If a heifer reaches 250 kg at around 12 months and is in good nutritional condition, breeding at that age is usually not problematic.

### What Happens If Breeding Occurs Before Sexual Maturity?

1. **Poor fetal development**, leading to reduced birth weights and lower calf survival rates.
2. **Underdeveloped mammary glands**, which may lower calf-rearing success even if the calf is born healthy.
3. **Extended postpartum recovery**, which lengthens the reproductive cycle and is economically inefficient.
4. **Increased risk of abortion, dystocia (difficult birth), premature birth, or stillbirth**, which negatively impacts productivity.

These issues can contribute to reproductive failure, ultimately shortening the productive lifespan of the cow.

## ▣ Estrus and Optimal Insemination Timing

Effective breeding cow management heavily depends on **accurate estrus detection** and **timely insemination**. When a cow is in estrus, it shows specific behavioral and physical signs that farmers must closely observe. Correct estrus identification helps maintain ideal breeding intervals and enables successful reproductive management.

### Behavioral Signs of Estrus:

- **6–10 hours before estrus**: the cow sniffs and licks other cows, allows mounting, and may mount others. While mounting cows are easier to spot, the mounted cow is 65–98% more likely to be in true estrus.
- The **vulva becomes moist, reddened, and slightly swollen**. If bleeding is observed, it usually indicates estrus has ended 2–3 days earlier.
  
### During Estrus (about 18 hours):

- The cow allows mounting, frequently bellows, appears restless, avoids people slowly, and has decreased appetite.
- The vulva becomes even more moist and red, with clear mucus discharge.
- Eyes may appear slightly bloodshot.
- After estrus, the cow does not allow mounting for about 10 hours, though clear mucus may continue to discharge.

Estrus can also be detected through other signs:
- **Mucus discharge**, which is heaviest at the start of estrus and diminishes over time.
- Frequent urination, nervousness, anxiety, decreased appetite.
- Increased walking activity (2–4 times more than normal).
- Loud vocalizations and leaning or licking other cows.

### Importance of Nutrition:

Proper nutritional levels make estrus detection easier. Since ovulated eggs survive only 6–10 hours, identifying the **optimal time for insemination** is critical. The average estrous cycle in Hanwoo cows is about **21 days**. If estrus is missed, farmers must wait another 21 days, lengthening the breeding interval.

Even after conception, if nutrition is excessive or there are ovarian abnormalities, **false estrus** (pseudo-estrus) may occur. Approximately 10–15% of pregnant cows show signs of false estrus, which requires careful nutritional and reproductive management by the farmer.
