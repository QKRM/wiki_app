## 1. Beef Cattle (육우, 肉牛)

Beef cattle generally refer to cattle raised for the purpose of beef production. This includes Holstein dairy bulls, non-lactating dairy heifers, and various meat breeds. In Southeast Asia, beef cattle mostly refer to local native breeds and brown crossbreeds.

The beef cattle industry plays a key role in supplying beef to local markets by fattening native and imported cattle. Most importantly, it serves to protect the local beef market and meet the growing demand for livestock products.

Currently, in the Southeast Asian beef market, beef cattle play an important role in the income of livestock farmers. Despite a challenging environment—marked by rising compound feed prices and decreasing livestock production—the industry remains crucial for sustaining rural livelihoods.
