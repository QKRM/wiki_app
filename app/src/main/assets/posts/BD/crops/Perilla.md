## Perilla (Perilla frutescens)

### Overview

- Recently, as food is increasingly recognized not just as a meal but as a means of healing and improving one's constitution, interest in the health benefits of perilla has grown. The alpha-linolenic acid found in perilla oil is an omega-3 fatty acid, and its known health functions have led to rising demand.

- Perilla (Perilla frutescens) is a plant belonging to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is native to Asian countries. It is used in cooking and traditional medicine. As an important field crop, it plays a significant role as edible oil, fresh leafy vegetable, and culinary supplement.

- Cultivated primarily for consumption, perilla is rich in nutrients and has various pharmacological properties, including antibacterial, anticancer, preservative, antipyretic, and immune-modulating effects. It is also a rich source of antioxidants.

### Feed Value of Perilla Meal

- In recent years, perilla extracts and perilla meal have been actively used in livestock and poultry farming. Research has shown that perilla meal, the by-product remaining after oil extraction, also provides beneficial effects when added to animal feed.

- Perilla meal is a nutrient-rich by-product of perilla oil extraction. It contains high levels of protein (35–45%), fiber (55–65%), and small amounts of polysaccharides, polyols, fatty acids, phytosterols, flavonoids, and phenolic compounds.

- Compounds such as flavonoids and polyphenols found in perilla meal have been found to play important roles in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions in animals.

- In a study published by Ying Wen Zhang et al. in Animals (2023, 13:22), it was reported that adding 0.6% perilla meal to poultry feed resulted in reduced mortality rates in chickens, among other positive effects. The study highlighted that perilla meal supplementation improves lipid metabolism and antioxidant capacity, lowers mortality in late-laying hens, and increases fertilization and hatching rates.

- Adding 0.6% perilla meal to layer feed improves the overall health condition of hens and brings significant economic benefits.

## Perilla Cultivation Techniques

- In direct sowing of perilla (sowing seeds directly into the soil), apply nitrogen, phosphate, potassium, and soil insecticide evenly across the field about two weeks before sowing, then perform tillage. For manual direct sowing, the ideal spacing is 60 cm between rows and 25 cm between plants, placing 5 to 6 seeds per hole. The sowing rate is 300–500 g per 10 ares, and after initial germination, thin to leave only the healthiest seedling per spot.
**※ Broadcasting is also possible, but it requires a large amount of seed, so spot seeding (hill planting) is recommended. When broadcasting, mix the seeds with compost for more even distribution.**

The recommended fertilizer amounts per 10 ares are:

Urea (Nitrogen): 8.8 kg

Fused phosphate: 15 kg

Potassium chloride: 3.4 kg
```

- It is important to maintain sufficient soil moisture before and after sowing to improve germination rate. Since perilla seeds are small, sowing them too deep will lower germination, so they should be planted shallowly, covered lightly with soil, and the soil moisture should be carefully managed to prevent drying. Soil-dwelling pests must also be controlled to prevent damage to young leaves.

- Right after germination, pests such as the common cutworm, tobacco cutworm, and black cutworm can cause serious damage. Monitor the field closely and apply insecticide early if damage is detected. Damping-off disease is also common, so apply a fungicide 1–2 times to prevent it.

- If weeds become dominant, plant growth will suffer, so apply a grass-selective herbicide. During the rainy season, late blight can occur easily, so ensure proper drainage is in place. After the rainy season, rust may occur, which can reduce yield, so apply preventive fungicide.

- During the middle growth stage, pests such as leafrollers, beet armyworms, and mites can damage new shoots by feeding or forming webs. Early detection and treatment are essential. In the maturity stage, lygus bugs (e.g., Apolygus spinolae) may appear, so monitor the field regularly and control them as needed.
