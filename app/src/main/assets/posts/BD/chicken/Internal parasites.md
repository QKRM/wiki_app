The most common internal parasites are coccidian protozoa, roundworms and tape worms.

|Coccidiosis|• This is one of the devastating diseases of housed birds, especially chicks.<br>• The birds get infected when they pick eggs of the parasite from contaminated litter.<br>• Coccidiosis in poultry affects the intestines.<br>• The disease occurs when litter management is not proper (leaving wet litter in the house).|
|Cause|• Protozoa (small internal parasite)|
|Signs and symptoms|• Affected birds are dull with no appetite (Figure 53), weak, dehydrated and thin.<br>• Diarrhea with blood tints in the advanced stage of the disease. At this time the disease has reached a critical level and losses are high.<br> • Death in young chicks. If the chicks survive, they will remain thin and be late in laying.|
|Prevention|• Avoid overcrowding and provide adequate ventilation.<br>• Avoid different age groups of birds in the same house, as the disease may spread from adults to young chicks.<br>• Avoid unhygienic conditions e.g., wetting the litter.<br>• Buy feed and water troughs which cannot easily be made dirty or allow spillage of water on the litter. Remove any wet litter around the drinkers and keep litter dry and friable<br>• Give coccidiostats e.g., sulpha, amprolium every two weeks till when brooding is over for local birds|
|Treatment|• Anticoccidials in drinking water or feed as recommended by the vet or manufacturer<br> • Birds whose intestinal walls are severely damaged by the parasite often die despite treatment. Therefore, prevention of coccidiosis outbreak is the most important in managing this disease.|

|Roundworms Tapeworms|• Internal parasites are very common in all ages in the village-based production systems.|
|Cause|• Roundworms (Ascaridia galli) are found in small intestines. They are round, white or yellowish-white and 1-4 inches long. The worms can cause intestinal obstruction and death of the chicks.<br>• Gapeworms (Syngamus trachea) lodges in the windpipe/trachea and Causes gaping/gasping in birds.<br>• Caecal worms are found in the caecum. They are harmless to chicken but are carriers of poultry diseases like the blackhead of turkeys<br> • Tapeworms: Chicken gets these worms by eating snails, earthworms, and flies carrying the tapeworm. They cause anemia, poor growth, and decreased production|
|Signs and symptoms|• Poor health, weight loss, drops in egg production, and bloody diarrhea. The worms can also be seen in the faeces.|
|Prevention|• Careful hygiene may prevent heavy infection<br>• Avoid overcrowding and if rearing chicken intensively, provide fresh litter when introducing new poultry stock.|
|Treatment|• The best treatment is adding anthelmintics in the drinking water once or twice a year, or once every month. The common antihelmintics for chicken in Uganda are levamisole (leviworm®, Levacide® poultry) and piperazine (ascarex®, piperamentic®) (Figure 55). Albendazole is also used at times when tapeworms are present.|
