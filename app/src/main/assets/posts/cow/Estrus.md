# Estrus Expression and Observation

When a cow comes into estrus, the average duration is about **18 to 21 hours**. It is crucial to observe this period accurately. The most effective and practical observation method is to check twice a day (early morning and evening). Around **43% of estrus occurs between midnight and 6 a.m.**, making nighttime observation especially important.

Careful identification of individual cows, proper breeding records, and detailed observation are essential for successful reproductive cow management.

## Table 6. Methods of Estrus Detection

| Detection Method                     | Detection Rate (%) | Remarks               |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Self-observation                    | 77%                 |                        |
| Teaser bull                         | 98%                 |                        |
| General observation by workers      | 56%                 |                        |
| Observation 3 times/day             | 81–90%              | Every 12 hours         |
| Observation 2 times/day             | 81–91%              | Every 12 hours         |
| Observation 24 hours                | 98–100%             |                        |
| Mounting cow                        | 36–37%              |                        |
| Cow being mounted                   | 65–98%              |                        |

Observation twice a day is highly recommended and can detect estrus in up to 90% of cases. As mentioned earlier, it's more accurate to identify the cow **being mounted** than the one **mounting**.

In small-scale farms where the barn is close to the house, 24-hour monitoring allows for nearly 100% detection accuracy. For larger farms where individual monitoring is difficult, using a **teaser bull** can be very effective.

# Guidelines for Determining Optimal Insemination Time

- Estrus typically lasts **18–20 hours**.
- Ovulation occurs approximately **8–11 hours after the end of estrus**, or around **29–30 hours after the onset of estrus**.
- The lifespan of the ovulated egg is **5–6 hours** (maximum **12–24 hours**).
- Sperm can remain viable for **24–40 hours** (up to **50 hours**).

**Ideal insemination timing** is around **18 hours after estrus begins** (late estrus phase).  
Best practice:
- If estrus is detected in the morning → inseminate in the late evening.
- If detected in the evening → inseminate the following morning.

# Guidelines for Estimating Calving Date

Many farmers neglect to record insemination dates and expected calving dates, which are essential for proper management. Recording the insemination date allows farmers to:
- Track pregnancy via return to estrus.
- Prepare for calving through accurate expected delivery dates.

**Example Calculation**:  
Insemination date: March 25, 1998  
Expected month: March - 3 = **December**  
Expected day: 25 + 10 = **January 4, 1999**

# Estrus Return After Calving

The average number of days for estrus to return after calving is **50–60 days** (range: **30–90 days**). This period varies by individual and is influenced by:

1. **Uterine Recovery**: Poor nutrition delays estrus return.
2. **Lactation**: Continued suckling causes hormonal changes (oxytocin, prolactin), delaying or weakening estrus. Early weaning can shorten the estrus return period.
   - After 2–3 months of lactation, the dam’s milk alone cannot meet the calf’s nutritional needs.
   - By 1 month, the calf’s **TDN** (Total Digestible Nutrients) requirement is 29% unmet.
   - By 3 months, **CP** (Crude Protein) and **TDN** are short by about 70% and 77%, respectively.

   ➤ Therefore, extending suckling to 3–4 months is not ideal.

3. **Age and Parity**: Younger cows and those with fewer calvings tend to have delayed estrus return. Breeding cows that are not yet sexually mature can shorten their productive lifespan.
