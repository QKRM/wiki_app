## Definition and advantages of programmed hatching

Programmed hatching is a method of using hens to incubate eggs for more than one batch and the chicks are raised as a batch of the same age. In short, the hens are used as incubators for many eggs from different hens. Programmed hatching is a fast and cheap way of increasing numbers of chickens on a farm. The essence of the program is the timing (synchronization) of hatching by a group of local hens to produce large numbers of day-old chicks of the same age or age bracket. The advantages include:

* Many chicks are hatched on the same day and so it is easier to vaccinate and manage the birds.
* Batch formation of the birds is easier, which makes it also easier to feed in groups.
* Farmers can plan in advance when to market the birds (timing festive seasons for good markets).
* No incubators are required hence the innovation is appropriate for rural areas.
* Birds may hatch up to seven times a year compared with two or three times with ordinary incubation and chick-rearing by hens.
* Chicks are produced at cheaper costs since farmers don’t need to transport them from distant towns, as is the case with commercial chicks.
* The programmed hatching approach has the potential of quickly tripling original stock numbers in a year when practiced diligently. Crossbreeding more productive poultry strains such as Kuroilers with the local chickens, on the other hand, can improve egg numbers, sizes and body weights of the subsequent offspring. This offers the additional advantages of ease of management and disease resistance of the indigenous breed.

## Raising the flocks for programmed hatching

It is easy to start programmed hatching with the same age group of hens raised together or hens that start laying around the same time. Otherwise, it is sometimes challenging to start the program. To begin the program, one can choose among the following options:

* Buy chicks or pullets of the same age bracket (not exceeding one-month age difference) from a known source. Raise them together under the same management until the start of egg-laying.
* Select pullets from your flock in similar age bracket not exceeding one-month age difference and raise them specifically to start programmed hatching. It must be pullets from parents with desired traits.
* Wean already brooding hens around the same time and raise the chicks by yourself. Introduce cocks to the weaned hens a week after, to stimulate breeding activities.

In all these options, we are interested in having hens that will start laying around the same time so that we reap the benefits of programmed hatching stated above. So, hens are the most critical limiting stock to acquire. Cocks can be introduced only when you are about a week to start the program. A cock should not stay in the place for more than 6 months to prevent inbreeding. 

The stock for the program should be cared for in terms of supplementary feeding, disease prevention e.g., by vaccinations and control of inbreeding.

## Synchronization of hens, managing egg-laying and incubation process
* To synchronize hens in this program means making them start laying around the same time or hatch around the same time. Synchronization is challenging in local birds with different ages but a reasonable level can be achieved.
* If we start with chicks or pullets of the same age, we wait until 30% of them start to lay and introduce the cocks. Or the cocks may be introduced when the pullets are at 5 months of age. Remember egg laying can start even without the cocks being present.
* The other alternative is to remove cocks from an existing flock and re-introduce them when at least 5 hens have just started laying. Also, remember that one mating can result into fertile eggs for three days.
* If we have hens moving around with their chicks, we have to separate them and raise the chicks indoors. We then introduce cocks to the separated hens a week after the weaning.
* To ensure high fertility of the eggs, it is recommended to keep one cock for every eight hens.
* Each hen is given its own laying nest. The nests should be numbered for hen identification and production records. The nests should not allow for the neighbour’s eggs to be seen when a hen is sitting on its eggs.
* Once a hen starts to lay, the first egg is removed, boiled, marked with a pencil and placed back into the nest as a decoy. Boiling the egg reduces the chances of spoilage and egg bursting to contaminate others.
* Every day, the eggs laid are removed and the date of removal is marked with a pencil on the broad side of each egg. The eggs are put on clean egg trays with broad ends facing up and stored in a secure, cool and humid place, for example in a box in a hole in the floor of the coolest part of the house.
* Eggs should be fresh before incubation. The age of eggs should be no more than 7 days, when stored in a cool place.
* Usually, after a while, one bird starts incubating by staying overnight on the boiled egg. This bird is not given any fertile eggs but is left to sit on the decoy (marked boiled egg) for about ten days or until others start to incubate. After about ten days from when the first bird started sitting on the egg, most other hens will have started sitting on their decoy eggs as well.
* All incubating hens are then given 10 to 12 fertile eggs each, starting from the ones which were laid last. Eggs from a hen do not have to be incubated by the hen that laid them. So, they can be placed randomly.
* To obtain the best incubation result, the eggs selected for incubation should be of average size and normal shape for the breed. When giving eggs for hens to sit on, avoid the following types of eggs for hatching:
    * Eggs that are too small
    * Eggs that are too round/spherical
    * Eggs that are too big
    * Eggs that are too pointed/sharpened or with any abnormal eggshells (including cracks). If there are cracks in the shell, the loss of moisture from the egg can be too high and the embryo may die. There is also a risk of bacteria entering the egg, which may lead to unhealthy or dead embryos.
    * Very dirty eggs (with droppings or manure on them).
* Sanitation of laying nests is important, as well as food and water for the incubating hens. Also important is external parasite control in incubating birds.
* During incubation you should always check, which eggs are fertile and which are nonfertile. Fertile eggs very quickly develop blood vessels, which may be seen against a sharp light from a torch after one week of incubation already

_Identification of infertile eggs (a), fertile eggs (b) and eggs with dead_
* After 7-10 days of incubation the eggs can be candled and the infertile eggs and eggs with dead embryos can be removed from the nest. Figure 58 shows two simple candles and figure 59 shows how fertile eggs, infertile eggs and eggs with dead embryos are identified at the age of 7 days. When candling, a fertile egg has visible blood vessels and a dark spot that is the embryo. The blood vessels can be more or less developed depending on how strong the embryo is. If the embryo is dead, it is seen as a ring of blood around the embryo. An infertile egg has an enlarged air cell and the yolk causes and obvious dark area in the egg. It is important that infertile eggs and eggs with dead embryos are removed from the nest as they will decompose and may break and spoil the fresh eggs under incubation.

* When you want the birds to hatch on Thursdays, they are given the eggs on Wednesday evening, exactly three weeks earlier. The method works because chickens don’t count the eggs which they incubate nor the number of days they have sat on the eggs.
* Removal of chicks must be in the dark before the hen leaves a nest, otherwise, it may not incubate the next set of eggs.
* After removing the hatched chicks, the hens can be given a new batch of fertile eggs to sit on if desired.
