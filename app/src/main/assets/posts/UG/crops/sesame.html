        <h2>Sesame Seeds (Sesamum indicum L.)</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The origin of sesame is believed to be in tropical regions such as Africa or India. It is a crop that can be safely cultivated in Southeast Asia and Africa, producing high-quality oil. The remaining sesame meal after oil extraction is also valuable as animal feed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scientific name of sesame is Sesamum indicum L., and it is also known by names such as beme, til, or gingerly depending on the country. In Latin America, it is referred to as ajonjolí. The brown by-product remaining after oil extraction is called sesame cake or sesame meal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sesame is one of the oldest oilseed crops in history and is especially produced in large quantities in Asian countries such as China and India. The seeds vary in color from white to black and contain 44–54% oil. Sesame meal, like other oilseed meals, is produced by either pressing or solvent extraction. In the case of pressing, the meal still contains about 8–12% oil, which is usually extracted again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sesame meal is high in essential amino acids such as methionine and tryptophan, but it is low in lysine. Therefore, it shows complementary effects when used together with ingredients high in lysine and low in methionine, such as soybean meal or yeast protein. It is important not to exceed a heating temperature of 110°C during processing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sesame Cultivation Techniques</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The optimal temperature for sesame germination is 15–20°C, and the ideal temperature for growth is 22–28°C. Sesame should be sown with a plant spacing of 20–25 cm between individual plants. For sowing, dig holes at the designated spacing, place 3–5 seeds in each hole, and cover them lightly with soil, just enough to hide the seeds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sesame does not require a large amount of fertilizer. If base fertilizer is applied before sowing, topdressing is not needed until harvest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since sesame grows tall, it has a high risk of lodging (falling over) during growth. Installing support stakes and tying the stems with string can help prevent the stalks from bending or breaking.</p>
</li>

<p><em>hold with support</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sesame is not a water-loving crop. Water should only be provided if the soil becomes excessively dry. During the harvest period, it is better to grow the plants under somewhat dry conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compared to perilla, sesame is more susceptible to pests and diseases. Major diseases include damping-off, wilt, leaf blight, leaf spot, mosaic virus, powdery mildew, and damage from moth larvae. To prevent and control these issues, ensure good air circulation and use natural insecticides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pinching (topping) is important. This should be done about 20 days before harvest, or around 40 days after flowering, when approximately 25 flower clusters have formed. The most reliable timing for pinching is when the main stem, after growing well, begins to bend at a certain point—this is the ideal moment to pinch the top.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The optimal harvest time is when the leaves turn brown and 1–2 seed pods on the lower part of the stem begin to open. At this point, cut the stems and dry them in bundles of 5 to 8, standing them upright in a sunny location.</p>
</li>
</ul>
