## Corn

Corn is a crucial raw material for livestock feed, highly valued in the animal husbandry industry as one of the most efficient feed crops due to its high yield per unit area. It is highly palatable to livestock and boasts excellent quality and nutritional value. Since 61.2% of total nutrients are concentrated in the ears at the waxy ripening stage, harvesting at this phase is optimal for feed use.

In poultry farming, corn can comprise up to 80% of feed. Chickens fed corn gain weight rapidly and develop softer meat texture due to its high omega-6 fatty acid content, which increases fat deposition.

Corn Planting Guide
### Seed Rate
* Quantity: 2–2.5 kg per 10 acres (≈4.9–6.2 lbs/acre).
* Seed Quality: Use certified seeds with >90% germination rate.

### Spacing & Plant Density
* Row Spacing: 60 cm (24 inches).
* Plant Spacing: 30 cm (12 inches) within rows.
* Density: ~5,500 plants per 10 acres (≈1,360 plants/acre).

### Practical Notes
* Sowing Depth: 3–5 cm (1.2–2 inches) in moist soil.
* Precision: Use mechanical planters for uniform spacing.
* Thinning: Retain 1 healthy seedling per hole after germination.

### Key Adjustments for Clarity
* Converted metric units to imperial equivalents in parentheses.
* Added context (e.g., seed certification, tools) for practicality.

* The amount can be adjusted depending on soil fertility. Lime should be applied at 300 kg per 10 ares every 3 years.  
* Corn is a crop with high adaptability to various soil types, but the most suitable soil pH is between 5.5 and 8.0. Well-drained and fertile soil is ideal. Since corn requires good soil aeration and drainage, clayey soil, poorly drained fields, or excessively dry sandy soil are not suitable. The best soil for corn cultivation is loam, which has a good balance of sand and clay, with a hydrogen ion concentration (pH) of 6.5 in water.  
* Corn has the highest grain yield per unit area, can be easily grown anywhere, and has good fertilizer absorption capacity. Up to a certain level, yield increases with the amount of fertilizer applied. Generally, corn is less susceptible to pests and diseases compared to other crops, and it grows well under a wide range of environmental conditions due to its low soil selectivity.  
* For planting, space the rows 60 cm apart and plant seeds 25 cm apart within the row. Sow 1–2 seeds per spot and thin them to one plant per hill after germination. Herbicides must be applied within 3–4 days after sowing to prevent weeds from competing with the corn.

## Cultivation Conditions

The optimal temperature for corn germination is 32–34°C (minimum: 8–11°C, maximum: around 40°C).

* Days required for emergence based on soil temperature:
    * At 13°C: 19–20 days
    * At 15–18°C: 8–10 days
    * At 21°C or higher: 4–6 days
* The optimal temperature for growth is 26–32°C during the day and 16–18°C at night.
    * ※ Growth stops below 10°C, and frost damage occurs below -1.7°C.
* During the pollen-shedding period, temperatures should remain below 35°C (pollination rate decreases above 35°C).
* Optimal rainfall:
    * May–June: 80–90 mm
    * July: 120 mm
    * August: 130 mm
    * September: 70 mm
* Soil texture: Loam to silty loam
* Soil pH: 5.5–8.0

## Management by Condition

|Condition|Details|
|---|---|
|Drought|● During early growth, hill soil deeply to break shallow roots near the surface and promote deep root growth.<br>● Irrigate between furrows to allow moisture to penetrate the ridges.|
|Excess Moisture|● Improve drainage in compacted or poorly drained areas using deep plowing or subsurface drainage.<br>● Plant on raised beds.<br>● Use organic matter and soil conditioners to improve soil structure and water permeability.<br>● Apply potassium and micronutrients as foliar sprays: 2% potassium solution.|

Corn is a vigorously growing crop that absorbs and utilizes large amounts of nutrients. Since the nutrients naturally present in the soil are not sufficient, an appropriate amount of fertilizer must be applied. Organic compost and phosphate fertilizers should be applied as base fertilizers, while nitrogen and potassium fertilizers should be split, with half applied as topdressing. Topdressing is applied by digging between the plants at intervals of 20 to 25 days after planting.


**※ When using corn as feed, it is very important to pay close attention to nutrient levels and toxic substances, especially mycotoxins. Mycotoxins are metabolic by-products produced by fungi and can be harmful to the health of both animals and humans.**
