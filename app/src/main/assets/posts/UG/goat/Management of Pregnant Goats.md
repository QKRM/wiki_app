# 1. Management of Pregnant Goats

## □ Gestation Period

Once a female goat (doe) mates and conception occurs, the fertilized egg implants in the uterus and continues to develop into a fetus. The gestation period in goats typically lasts **147 to 154 days**, with an average of **150 days**.

However, this duration can vary depending on several factors such as:
- Parity (number of previous births)
- Season
- Feeding and management conditions
- Number of kids
- Fetal sex
- Individual characteristics

## □ Signs of Pregnancy

The average estrous cycle in goats is about 21 days. Therefore, if a doe does not show signs of estrus 21 days after mating, she is likely pregnant—with approximately 90% accuracy using this method.

However, since black goats usually breed naturally, pregnancy can go unnoticed without careful observation. It is important for the caretaker to monitor for the following pregnancy signs:

- Regular estrus cycles stop occurring.
- The doe becomes calmer and more cautious in movement, often lying in shaded areas.
- Increased appetite leads to better nutritional status, resulting in weight gain and a shinier coat.
- During mid-pregnancy, the right side of the abdomen enlarges, and fetal movement may be felt by hand.
- In late pregnancy, fetal movement can be seen externally, and the udder gradually enlarges.
- As parturition nears, the vulva becomes relaxed and congested.
- Just before delivery, mucous discharge appears from the vagina, and yellowish-white **colostrum** can be expressed from the teats.

## □ Management of Pregnant Goats

Proper care of pregnant goats is crucial for maintaining the health of the mother, ensuring fetal development, and preparing for successful lactation after birth. Poor management during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, so caretakers should pay close attention to the following:

- Provide moderate exercise but avoid running or long-distance transportation.
- From around 3 months into pregnancy, fetal growth accelerates—so supply **high-quality feed**. Avoid overfeeding to prevent obesity, which may cause difficult labor.
- Allow sufficient sun exposure and **add 2–3% salt** to the feed.
- After **day 145 of pregnancy**, move the doe to a clean, bedded birthing pen to rest and prepare for delivery.
