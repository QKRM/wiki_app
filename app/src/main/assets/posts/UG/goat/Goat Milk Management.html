        <h1>Goat Milk Management</h1>
<h2>□ Colostrum Must Be Fed</h2>
<p>Goats generally practice natural nursing, so issues related to not feeding colostrum are rare. However, it is <strong>essential</strong> that newborn kids receive colostrum <strong>for at least the first week</strong> after birth.</p>
<p><strong>Colostrum</strong> is the first milk secreted immediately after birth. It is rich in nutrients, containing <strong>10 to 100 times more vitamin A</strong> than regular milk, and is packed with <strong>immune antibodies</strong>. It also helps stimulate the expulsion of <strong>meconium (first feces)</strong>.</p>
<p>Newborn kids are <strong>not born with maternal antibodies</strong>, so they must absorb these antibodies <strong>through colostrum</strong> to develop immunity against various diseases.</p>
<p>However, since antibody concentration <strong>decreases quickly</strong> after birth, it is best to feed colostrum <strong>within the first hour</strong>.</p>
<p>If the mother goat dies during delivery or cannot feed colostrum for other reasons, colostrum from <strong>another recently kidding goat</strong> can be used. If that is not available, a <strong>colostrum substitute</strong> can be made by mixing:
- 500 mL of milk<br />
- Half a tablespoon of castor oil<br />
- 1 egg white<br />
Feed <strong>20–30 mL per dose, 3 times a day for 3–4 days</strong> as a substitute.</p>
<hr />
<h2>□ Milking Goats</h2>
<p>Goats begin producing milk immediately after giving birth. However, during the <strong>first 1–2 weeks</strong>, you should <strong>not milk the goat</strong>, as the <strong>colostrum is needed for the kid</strong>.</p>
<p>After 2 weeks, goats can be milked <strong>twice a day (morning and evening)</strong> for <strong>approximately 9–10 months</strong>. It is recommended that all goats complete their lactation period <strong>at least 2 months before the next mating</strong>.</p>
<p>Goats can be milked <strong>by hand or using a milking machine</strong> (costing around <strong>$200–$700</strong>). In both cases, <strong>hygiene is critical</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sterilize the milk container with <strong>boiled water</strong>.</li>
<li>Secure the goat on a <strong>milking stand</strong>, holding its <strong>head and hind legs</strong> in place. Once the goat becomes accustomed, restraint may no longer be necessary.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>○ Hand Milking</h3>
<p>Inexperienced farmers may stress the goat to speed up milking, but it is better to keep the goat calm by offering <strong>tasty feed</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Wash the <strong>udder and teats</strong> with <strong>warm water</strong> to clean and relax the area.</li>
<li>Dry the teats with a <strong>clean, dry towel</strong>.</li>
<li>Begin milking using <strong>proper hand technique</strong>:</li>
<li>Avoid pulling the teats downward, as this can cause injury.</li>
<li>Use your <strong>thumb and forefinger</strong> to trap and squeeze the teat, gently pressing downward to extract milk.</li>
<li>Initially, it may take <strong>10–15 minutes per goat</strong>, but with practice, <strong>5 minutes per goat</strong> is typical.</li>
</ol>
<p>After milking:
- Clean the teats again using <strong>water and soap</strong> or a <strong>special sanitizing solution</strong>.
- It is common to dip the teats in an <strong>antibacterial solution</strong>, but <strong>boiled water</strong> is also effective for sanitization.</p>

<h3>○ Machine Milking</h3>
<p>When using a <strong>milking machine</strong>, it is essential to <strong>thoroughly clean all parts of the equipment</strong> with appropriate cleaning agents <strong>before and after milking</strong>.</p>
<p>Most portable milking machines consist of:
- A <strong>milking claw</strong>
- A <strong>pump</strong>
- A <strong>milk bucket or container</strong></p>
<p>Even when using a machine, it is important to <strong>start and finish milking by hand</strong> for several reasons:
- To <strong>check the condition of the milk</strong>, especially for <strong>traces of blood</strong>.
- To ensure proper stimulation and complete emptying of the udder.</p>
<p>When the machine is powered on, milk is drawn through the <strong>claw under vacuum pressure</strong>, then flows through the <strong>tubing</strong> and finally into the <strong>collection bucket</strong>.</p>
<p>After milking:
- Remove the unit carefully.
- <strong>Clean the teats</strong> with a <strong>disinfectant solution</strong>, just as you would during hand milking.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ <strong>Note:</strong><br />
Goats often become <strong>dehydrated</strong> after milking. Therefore, it is important to provide <strong>fresh water and hay</strong> immediately after milking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Typically, milk should be <strong>stored in a refrigerator</strong> right after milking. Alternatively, it can be <strong>pasteurized at a low temperature and then cooled</strong> for safe storage and use.</p>
