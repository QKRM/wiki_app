<p>Diseases are everywhere and will attack birds at all ages causing heavy losses. Careful management will prevent many diseases and save costs from treatments and disinfection. Disease entry into poultry flock can be prevented in the following ways:
» Give the chicken the right feed and clean water, in particular for young birds;
» Build shelters against wind and rain;
» Clean houses regularly and apply lime wash on the floor and the walls;
» If necessary, provide dry litter regularly;
» Do not put too many birds together;
» Different species of poultry, for example hens, turkeys, pigeons, ducks and guinea fowls should be kept separate;
» Separate chicks from adult birds except from the mother hen;
» Vaccinate chicks against the most important diseases and revaccinate if necessary;
» Isolate and treat sick birds – if medication is not available then kill the sick birds;
» Burn or bury killed birds.
Chicken that are not well managed will have many diseases in the flock

<h2>Housing and Space</h2>
<p>Overcrowding of chicken in a small house and outdoor space leads to vices such as pecking. Overcrowding also results in increased contamination of the environment by chicken manure and may therefore lead to disease outbreaks. An adult bird requires at least 5 square meters of outside space. Therefore, keep only the numbers that fit comfortably in the available space.</p>
<h2>Hygiene</h2>
<p>Dry and clean housing is essential for diseases not to spread or develop. Once in a while after cleaning, houses and shelters should be disinfected with lime wash. It is best to slaughter hens that are too thin and do not grow or produce eggs any more, as they do not resist diseases well and can pass diseases to poultry in good health. If a disease persists on the farm, depopulate the whole flock, clean, disinfect and rest the house for some time (at least two months) and then restock. Example of a common disinfectant is in Figure 57. The instructions of how to use the disinfectants are usually written on the bottle and a small paper inserted with the package.</p>
<h2>Mixed species or age groups</h2>
<p>Other species of birds may carry diseases without showing any signs of being ill. For example, ducks, guinea fowls, and turkeys can pass on diseases to hens, or vice versa. The best way to avoid spreading diseases from one species to another is to keep them separate in different cages, baskets or houses. Always keep domesticated birds as far away from wild birds as possible. Also do not mix the chicks and adult chicken together to avoid transmission of disease from the adult to the young. Do not buy chicken from roadside or markets as breeding stock. They may carry diseases. Also, chickens that you take to market and are not bought should not be returned to the home stock.</p>
<h2>Feeding</h2>
<p>Well-fed birds resist diseases better. Supplementary feeding, in particular for small chicks, is one of the most important means of preventing diseases. Feeds should always be stored in a dry and clean place, as they may easily get contaminated and spread diseases.</p>
<h2>Clean Water</h2>
<p>Clean water from a well, not a pond, is important to avoid the spread of waterborne diseases, such as Fowl Cholera and Avian Influenza (AI). If a highly contagious strain of AI is present in the environment strict care should be taken to avoid water potentially contaminated by wild birds.</p>
<h2>Vaccinations</h2>
<p>Viral diseases do not have drugs for treatment in chickens. Diseases such as Newcastle disease and fowl pox should be vaccinated against regularly</p>
