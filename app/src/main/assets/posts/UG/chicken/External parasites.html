|External parasites|• Attacks all ages any time, but occurs more frequently in humid chicken houses with bad hygiene|
|Cause|• The common external parasites include fleas, lice and mites.<br>• The most common mites of poultry include feather mites, scaly legmites, red mites, and many others. All these parasites suck blood and cause discomfort by the birds.<br>|
|Sign and symptoms|• Lice and Stick-tight flea can be seen around eyes and nose, on the wattles and combs. Fleas can be seen on the belly.<br>• Adult birds are clearly disturbed and spend a lot of time pecking and polishing feathers. <br>• Young chicks may die from anemia.<br>• Scaly leg mites are small creatures that hide/burrow on the shanks of birds causing rough scaly or thickened legs with clear scales and wounds sometimes. <br>• Red mites feed mostly at night and may not be found on the birds during the day (hide in the cracks or joints of roosts or nests at daytime) Inspection at night is usually necessary to confirm an infestation. <br>• If not treated, mites, lice, fleas, ticks will cause weight loss and possibly loss of feathers due to the parasites sucking blood and to skin irritation. <br>• Sometimes, they lead to claws and/or body pecking symptoms|
|Prevention|• Ashes and Sulphur powder may be used where the hens do dust bathing. Nests may be protected by putting a few tobacco leaves mixed with ashes in the nest-|
|Treatment|Dust the birds with available anti-parasitic powders like Sevin dust. Ideally, do this in the evening when the birds are going to sleep. Replace the litter (in heavy infestation) and dust the house with insecticide, ash or oil, paying particular attention to the cracks and crevices.<br>• Against fleas: Smear some Vaseline mixed with little paraffin directly on the fleas. Avoid getting paraffin into contact with the eyes, or apply a little pye-grease on the affected parts<br>• Against scaly leg mites: Dip the legs daily in kerosene (paraffin) mixed with (waste engine or cooking oil (in the ratio of 1:1) or in an insecticide daily, until the scales disappear (at least 2 weeks). Wash the legs with soapy water before dipping.|</p>
