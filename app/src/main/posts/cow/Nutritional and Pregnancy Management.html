        <h2>Nutritional and Pregnancy Management</h2>
<h3>Feeding Guidelines for Growing and Breeding Cattle</h3>
<p>The key to managing growing heifers is to provide unlimited high-quality roughage (ad libitum). Before the pubertal period, daily weight gain should be maintained at 500–600g so that sexual maturity can be achieved by 12–15 months of age.</p>
<p>If purchasing breeding cows from outside, it is advisable to choose animals with healthy and smooth appearance rather than focusing on price. The feeding principle for growing heifers is to freely offer high-quality roughage and supplement only with concentrate to cover nutritional gaps. Sufficient roughage intake maximizes development of the rumen (1st and 2nd stomachs) and promotes the growth of the post-ruminal digestive system. </p>
<p>Insufficient roughage feeding may lead to digestive system or liver disorders and can shorten the productive lifespan of breeding cows. During this period, it is also beneficial to ensure sufficient intake of trace minerals and vitamins. While commercial supplements are available, adequate feeding of fresh forage, silage, and a small amount of concentrate feed usually provides sufficient nutrients.</p>
<p>The target weight gain for heifers varies depending on their maturity stage:
- Before sexual maturity: ~600g/day
- From sexual maturity to calving: ~400g/day</p>
<p>Roughages suitable for feeding include mountain grass, rice straw, green forage, and silage. The impact of nutrition level on growth and reproduction is significant. If undernutrition is about 20% below the standard, sexual maturity can be delayed by 2–3 months, increasing the open period, which is economically disadvantageous.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Management of Pregnant Cows</h3>
<p>From the beginning of pregnancy until about the 6th month, there is no need for special management, and the same feeding pattern used during the non-pregnant period can be maintained. However, during the early stages of pregnancy (3–4 months), cows should be protected from sudden shocks to prevent miscarriage.</p>
<p>The most important period in managing pregnant cows is the last 2–3 months before delivery, when fetal growth becomes rapid, accounting for about 70% of the total fetal development. During this period, nutrient redistribution alone is not sufficient for fetal growth, and therefore, the amount of digestible nutrients and crude protein provided should be increased by 20–30%.</p>
<p>Generally, farmers feed an additional 1kg of concentrate feed during this period to meet the increased requirements. For first-calf heifers, increasing concentrate feeding until calving helps improve milk production through udder development. This method is known as "steaming-up."</p>
<p>Additionally, feeding feed rich in beta-carotene 2 weeks before calving helps with early postpartum uterine recovery and promotes estrus, shortening the breeding interval. Beta-carotene is abundant in leafy plants, hay, and yellow corn.</p>
<p>It is also advisable to administer fat-soluble vitamin preparations or selenium injections 2 weeks before calving to prevent calf white muscle disease, retained placenta, and stillbirths. Commercial products containing vitamin E and selenium (e.g., from Schering) may be used. Vaccinations should be given 4 and 2 weeks before calving to prevent virus infections in calves.</p>

<h3>Management of Cows at Calving</h3>
<p>After calving, it is important to immediately check whether the cow can nurse the calf. If the cow is a heifer with underdeveloped udders or refuses to nurse, force-feeding with thawed frozen colostrum obtained in advance from nearby dairy farms is necessary. Artificial feeding should then continue.</p>
<p>If a cow refuses to nurse, forced correction should be applied for 1–3 days to encourage nursing. If this fails, artificial feeding is the best option.</p>
<p>The nutritional intake of lactating cows should remain the same as immediately before calving to aid uterine recovery and meet lactation energy demands.</p>
<p><strong>General postpartum management includes:</strong>
- Maintaining proper nutrition levels
- Providing exercise and sunlight to promote vitamin D synthesis
- Improving blood circulation and uterine recovery
- Promoting estrus return</p>
<p>Since lactation can delay the return of estrus, early weaning of calves is advisable. Once calves consume about 500g of milk replacer, weaning is possible.</p>
<p>For example:
- Calves weaned at day 40: estrus returns ~22.8 days later
- Calves weaned at day 60: estrus returns ~26.8 days later</p>
