        <h2>Management of the chicks and brooding</h2>
<ul>
<li>When the chicks are removed from the hens they are placed in a brooding area.</li>
<li>The period in the brooder is from hatching to 6 – 8 weeks for local birds.</li>
<li>Brooding is the most delicate stage in the life of the chicks because they are very vulnerable to diseases and other stressful conditions. Heavy losses may occur in this period when not done correctly. If the brooding methods are satisfactory, mortality in chicks should not exceed 5% during the first 8 weeks of life. Farmers should, therefore, be very careful during brooding.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following activities should be carried some weeks before chicks arrive:</p>
<h2>Preparation of the Brooder to receive the chicks</h2>
<p>• Construct a brooder (see chapter 2) or carry the necessary repairs on the existing building. Ensure that the house does not leak- rainwater does not enter the windows-,the house does not let in draughts (cold wind) and rodents or predators. It may be necessary to block some windows with papyrus mats, cardboards or old sack to reduce draughts and regulate ventilation. Do not use polythene material to block, as it does not allow air circulation through them.
• Acquire hurricane lamps or gas lamps as sources of light if necessary. The target should be to provide bright light with which you can also read newspapers in the room, at the level of the chick. Hang the lamps to provide uniform light in the brooder.
• Clean and disinfect the brooder (see chapter 6). If it has been used before, remove the old litter. Wash and clean the whole room, the outside concrete runs, and equipment inside. The house is left for 2-4 weeks to fallow (idle) before bringing in a new batch. This ensures that most disease agents die.
• The sharp corners of the brooder should be rounded to prevent the chicks from piling in corners and suffocating.</p>
<h2>Litter and feeding management in the first days</h2>
<p>• Coffee or rice husks or any other good litter material are poured on the ground to form a deep (3-4 inches) litter.
• The litter should not be damp and mouldy nor should it be dusty.
• During the first week, the husks are covered with paper/feed sacks. This ensures that the chicks that have not developed their olfactory sense do not mistake the litter for food and eat it, causing impaction. The newspaper also reduces the chances of navel infection in the first few days of life. Do not use polythene paper to cover the litter because it does not absorb water from droppings or spillage from water troughs.
• To teach the chicks to feed, the first three days’ chick feed is placed as mounds on the paper.
• The next three days, feed is provided in a new and unused carton of egg trays
• After that, feeding troughs adapted to the size of the chicken are provided</p>
<h2>Heating the brooder</h2>
<p>• Chicks have higher temperature requirement. When they are brooded naturally, the hen knows exactly how to adjust the temperature. In the case of programmed hatching, a source of heat shall be provided to the chicken in the first weeks of life.
• The brooder is heated for at least 12-24 hours (3 hours in emergencies) before the chicks are stocked in.
• A cheap source of heat for the chicks is provided through charcoal or charcoal briquettes.
• To make a charcoal briquette, charcoal powder (waste) is mixed with sticky soil and moulded in balls which are then left to dry and become hard.
• The briquettes are lighted and placed in a clay pot which is placed on some stones in the brooding area.
• When the chicks are small, they need to be kept together and close to the heat source through a chick guard.
• A chick guard is a circle of plywood, cardboard, plastic, papyrus mat or wire mesh, can be made around the heat source if the brooder is large. It limits the movement of chicks away from the heat source. The chick guard is 3m in diameter and at least 2ft high for every 200 chicks</p>
<h2>Monitor the temperature using the behavior of chicks.</h2>
<p>When the temperature is high, chicks will run away from the heat source and breathe rapidly with open mouth. When the temperature is low, they will gather around the heat source. The chicks distribute evenly in the house when the temperature is normal or uniform. The temperature requirements of the chicks decrease quickly over the 4-6 weeks of life.
