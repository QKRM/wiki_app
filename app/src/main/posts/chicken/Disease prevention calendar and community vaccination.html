        <h2>Medication</h2>
<p>Some diseases may be cured by drugs. Parasitic diseases, such as lice or worms may be cured by use of anti-parasitic drugs or by applying simple methods such as baths in oil. Some bacterial diseases causing diarrhea, may be cured with antibiotics but this should only be done under the supervision of a veterinarian! For viral diseases there is no treatment. But the viral diseases may often be prevented by vaccination.</p>
<p><em>The old saying that “prevention is better than cure” is true for poultry diseases and parasites. This can be got by vaccination and good husbandry practices.</em></p>
<h2>Vaccination</h2>
<ul>
<li>Vaccines protect birds from diseases and should be done before the disease breaks out</li>
<li>All chicken should be vaccinated against the most common viral disease(s) in the area. Vaccination schemes at village level should cover Newcastle Disease and Fowl Pox.</li>
<li>Other viral diseases such as Gumboro and Infectious Bronchitis may be covered by vaccination, but they are often less important at village level.</li>
<li>A bacterial disease such as Fowl cholera may also be prevented by vaccination.</li>
<li>Poultry should be vaccinated when they are very young, and before they have begun to lay eggs. Most young birds that have not been vaccinated do not resist diseases, and often die.</li>
<li>Vaccines should only be given to healthy birds. If you vaccinate a sick bird, you may kill
the bird.</li>
<li>Anthelmintics against internal parasites should be given two weeks before vaccination, to improve the effect of the vaccine.</li>
<li>Vaccines should be stored properly in the cold/cool environment, usually at 2-8 °C.</li>
<li>Vaccines should be used promptly (within 2½ hours) after reconstitution (dilution). Always follow the manufacturer’s guidelines when you are using vaccines or contact a veterinarian for guidance.

<em>do not vaccinate sick birds</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Vaccination methods</h2>
<p>There are four fundamental ways of vaccinating birds:
|Methods|detail|
|---|---|
|Eye drops|Most vaccines in Uganda are administered by this route.Sometimes by nose or mouth drops. Examples of vaccines given as eye drops include Newcastle disease, Gumboro disease and infectious bronchitis|
|Injections|The vaccines of chicken given by injections into the muscle of the neck, breast or the thigh include Marek’s disease vaccine and Fowl typhoid vaccine. But these are more in exotic birds kept in intensive system.|
|Skin piercing|In this category, we have only fowl pox vaccine for local poultry in Uganda. It is injected in the skin of wing web using a forked needle|
|Orally(in feed or water)|Any of those that are administered by eye drop can be administered in water. This method is used for confined systems. For scavenging poultry, you should avoid mixing vaccines with drinking water or feed, as it is difficult to give the right dose. Research have shown that protection against e.g., Newcastle Disease is highly variable if vaccine is given through water or feed. Giving the right dose is essential for the vaccine to work properly.|</p>

<ul>
<li>A too high dose of a live vaccine may kill a young chick, whereas a too low dose will not give adequate protection. Thus, it is important to consult a veterinarian for further advice before carrying out a vaccination.</li>
<li>Most vaccines must be kept in the refrigerator between 4 and 8°C and never frozen.</li>
<li>When going to the field, vaccines must be stored in a cool box or wrap in a damp cloth, and not exposed to sunlight.</li>
<li>Vaccines should not be used after the expiry date.</li>
<li>Once a vaccine has been opened, it should be used immediately and not stored for use the following day.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vaccination program for local chicken</h2>
<p>The table below give an indication on which vaccination program is recommended for local chicken in Uganda. It is recommended to plan the exact timing of vaccination in a collaborative way with the local population, depending on the outbreak of the main disease, for example by producing a disease prevention calendar.</p>

<h2>How to administrate vaccine by eye drop (example against Newcastle disease)</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are about 16 ND vaccine brands currently in use in Uganda including Hipraviar-B1/ H120® (ND &amp; IB), Hipraviar-S® (ND), Newcastle Disease Vaccine®, ORNIPEST, ORNIPRIM and others. Generally, there are many trade names of ND vaccines and they keep changing overtime with entry of new stockists. Therefore, only asking for Newcastle disease vaccine for the number of birds owned is usually enough to buy the
vaccine plus the diluents.</li>
<li>Vaccines should be given either early morning, before letting the birds out of the chicken house or when the local birds are easy to catch resting in the trees.</li>
<li>Correct dilution of the vaccine is critical. The necessary diluent is sold together with the vaccine with the instruction to dilute. Please carefully follow these instructions.

<em>Eye drop administration. When using an eye-dropper, hold it in a vertical position. They are calibrated according to the size of the drop that forms when a dropper is held in a vertical position</em></li>
<li>Immunity does not develop immediately after administration of the vaccine. One to two weeks is required for full immune response to occur.</li>
<li>Chicken should be vaccinated at least one month before an outbreak is likely to occur: ask local village poultry farmers when ND outbreaks are most common and planvaccination campaigns in a collaborative basis (e.g., participatory disease calendar, see part 1).</li>
<li>Immunity will diminish if chickens are not revaccinated. Chickens are best vaccinated at least three times a year.</li>
<li>Chicken should be given a booster dose 2-4 weeks after primary vaccination, with revaccination at 3 months intervals.</li>
<li>Vaccination of village chicken poultry flocks at 3-4 months intervals will also provide protection for newly hatched chicks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Procedure for vaccination against fowl pox:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fowl pox vaccines currently in use in Uganda include Hiprapox®, Fowl Pox Vaccine® and others. The brands keep changing overtime, but during purchase, one needs to ask for fowl pox vaccine. The vaccine is sold together with the water for dilution and forked needle.</li>
<li>The common vials on the market are for 500 and 1000 chickens.</li>
<li>The following procedure must be followed to dilute the vaccine and vaccinate the chicken:<ul>
<li>Draw 20 mls of the water for dilution into a clean syringe (Figure 62).</li>
<li>Transfer the water into the solid vaccine in the bottle by piercing through the rubber cap.</li>
<li>Once dissolved, draw all the content with the syringe and mix thoroughly.</li>
<li>Transfer the mixture into a clean cup and keep in cool box with ice.</li>
<li>With the help of an assistant holding the chicken, stretch the wing, dip the forked needle eyes into the vaccine and pierce through the wing web, taking care to avoid feathers, bones, and large blood vessels</li>
<li>Put down the bird, get another one, pierce in the same way, until all the birds are covered.</li>
<li>Check the injection site in some selected birds after three days to see whether the vaccination was effective.</li>
<li>When well done, there will be small swelling at the injection site but none when not properly done.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One well done vaccination is enough for the lifetime of the chicken. You will only repeat vaccinations for young or new stock.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vaccination costs</h2>
<p>The costs of vaccines vary widely in Uganda depending on the location. Vaccines are cheaper in central Uganda than any other part of the country. This is due to city status of Kampala associated with many veterinary stockists and relatively more reliable electricity for cold storage of vaccines. Also, the central region has the large commercial poultry farms that use most of the poultry vaccines and drugs. For example, 500 dose vial of Newcastle disease vaccine costs on average Shs. 7000 in Kampala but the price in Arua is Shs. 15,000. The same dose vial of fowl pox vaccine costs Shs. 9000 in Kampala and Shs 18000 in Arua. These vaccines are sold together with the dilution fluid and eye droppers or syringes with needles. Vaccine carriers having ice packs are used for carrying the vaccines from the shops to the farms. The person buying the vaccine must carry his or her own vaccine carrier. The labour costs for vaccination vary among the vaccinators. It is between Shs. 50 to 300 per chicken in some villages of northern Uganda.</p>
